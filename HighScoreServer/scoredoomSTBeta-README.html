<h1> ScoreDoomST 0.97c2 Pre-Release</h1>


<pre>
(The 0.97c2 Pre-Release is the unofficial final release)
Changes from Beta5:

* SDST Add-on pack is now enforced on client authentication.
	-Since ScoreDoomST is hardcoded to use the SDST-Add-on Pack, clients that try and connect to a
	 server will be audited to see if they should be playing with the add-on pack, and if so, if
	 they have the 'correct' version that the server is running. Clients will be kicked if (i) they
	 need to add the pack, (ii) they need to remove the pack, (iii) they need to get the correct version
	 that the server is using.


* Extra health drops lessened.

* Tweaks to SDST add-on pack, including making the Boss-Rush more challenging.


TODO:
Get/create an SDST specfic version of a client like IDESE. Until I get around to developing an SDST
plugin for Dooseeker, players wll need to use the ST 97c2 Idese client. For instructions on how to configure
and use Idese with ScoreDoomST, read below.

 0.97c2 Pre-Release (w. SDST add-on pack)</a></b>

<br>
<b>Intro</b><br>
ScoreDoomST is an attempt to add arcade hi-scoring to Doom, similar to SmashTV.
Players compete against each other cooperatively to be the highest scorer either when the point-limit
is hit, or the last map in the map rotation ends, or at the end of the Doom episode/wad
(i.e. E1M8, MAP30).<br>
You can play with the SDST-ADDONPACK, which will give a ton of new monsters and artifacts, including a 'Boss
Rush' mode for levels like E1M8, E2M8 & E3M8.<br>
Furthermore you can also play with the 0.79c2 skulltag.wad, which can be grabbed from
<a href="http://skulltag.net/download/files/release/st-v097c2.zip">here</a>, This will give the skulltag
announcer voice, as well as a ton of new player skins to play with.

ScoreDoomST is a Multiplayer Client-server port of ScoreDoom using the
Skulltag v97c2 source release.
<br>
ScoreDoom has primitive multiplayer capabilities, and it is very
cumbersome and inefficient for internet
gameplay, ScoreDoomST was created to fix that.

<p><b>Purpose of 0.97c2 Beta 5</b><br><br>
To get information on any gameplay bugs (scoring etc...) pertinent to the
 mod, as well as any other quirks/bugs/crashes when using the add-on pack
<br>
Please post bug-reports, comments, feedback @ <a
href="http://scoredoom.com/phpBB2/" target="_blank">http://scoredoom.com/phpBB2/</a>

<br><br>
</p><pre>There is a Master Server for ScoreDoomST up at: 99.67.224.186:15300 which you can use for Idese

Or the ScoreDoomST client internal browser, via the ini:
cl_masterip=99.67.224.186
sv_masteroverrideip=99.67.224.186
sv_masterip=99.67.224.186
</pre>

<br><br>
<p><b>Add-on Pack Installation</b><br><br>
Place the add-on pack in the same directory as the scoredoomst executable. <br>
If you are running a server via Idese, specify the SDST-ADDONPACK.WAD as a PWAD.


<br><br>

<p><b>QuickStart Guide</b><br><br>
(Please see the link above and the Gameplay Summary Section below to
understand what ScoreDoom is all about.).

<br><br>



<!--ScoreDoomST is not compatible with the official Skulltag Master Server,
and if the Master Server above is not working, you should  start a server
with IDeSE, with 'Private Server' checked and/or LAN server checked, or
you may get 'WSAEADDRENOTAVAIL'
messages.
<br><br>-->
*IDeSe must first be set to look for scoredoomst.exe in the Options tab,
 since it defaults to look
for skulltag.exe*<BR>
Also, for the SDST Add-On Pack, which you should install in the same directory, you should
 specify the directory in Option/Wads where to look for the Add-On Pack as well as other wads.
<br><br>
The clients should be started with IDeSe too. <br>
Basically, when you create a server, share the IP with your co-players,
and have them add the IP to their their IdeSe
'Custom Server' list.
ScoreDoomST uses the 'Cooperative' gametype of SkullTag, so select that
when starting a server.
<br><br>


Single Player is not supported (see regular ScoreDoom for that), and the
 menus look just like Skulltag, but
the only game mode is 'ScoreDoom Cooperative' and the only votes you can
 call are 'MAP', 'KICK' and 'POINTLIMIT'.
<br><br>

<b>Using the MAP vote is essential in restarting ScoreDoom
games/campaigns, since all scores are set to 0, which essentially starts a new  Scoredoom Game.
(see 'Gameplay Summary'below).</b>
the future, there will be proper point-limits, time-limits and maplists to play against.

</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>ScoreDoomST Hosting Tips</b>
<pre style="font-size: 12px;">
ScoreDoomST naturally uses more bandwidth than regular Skulltag due to the more intense & continual
nature of the scoring, so clients get updated much more frequently.
Playing with the Add-on Pack, with the more exotic & complicated enemies and weaponary means more
entitities being spawned which can eat more banwidth.
If you plan to play intense wads like scythe2 with the add-on pack with more than 2 players, it may
be better to have a machine solely running as the server, though your mileage may vary.
I noticed when playing intense wads with the add-on pack, even with one person, that the server was
much more stable if it was running on its own dedicated machine, as opposed to sharing the same
machine with a player.
Add-on Pack support will probably remain in 'beta' after the final release, so if running a server
with it proves to be unstable, trying running a server without the pack loaded.

</pre>
</p>

<p><b>ScoreDoomST Add-On Pack</b>
</p><pre style="font-size: 12px;">
The SDST Add-On Pack adds:

*	Over 250 monsters.
*	Over 15 artifacts
*	alt-fire modes: double-speed/double inaccuracy for chaingun,
	grenade launcher for the rocket launcher,
	rail gun for the plasma rifle
	mini-nuke for the bfg.
*	Points Bunny (Daisy) & Zombie Scientist Bonuses
*	Boss-Rush modes for E1M8, E2M8, E3M8 type levels

*Make sure to enable secondary fire & jump in the controls options*

The SDST add-on pack is similar to the regular ScoreDoom add-on pack, except it is missing a few monsters, and has different artifacts.
</pre>


<br><br>
<p><b>ScoreDoomST Gameplay Summary</b>
</p><pre style="font-size: 12px;">For those familiar with ScoreDoom, ScoreDoomST gameplay is pretty much exactly the same concept, except
for some minor differences.

ScoreDoomST is a 'cooperative' gametype where players score points and compete against each other
like with Halo's campaign meta-game, and old-skool arcade 'ccoperative' games like Smash-TV.

A campaign in SDST is from the starting map selected (via a VOTE or whatever) till the final finale,
(E1M8, E2M8, etc... or MAP30), or if the pointlimit or maplimit is met, whereby the game resets back to the starting map of the pwad/iwad/episode
(E1M1, E2M1, etc... or MAP01). Points are accumulated across the levels played over, until the final
finale is reached, and the points are reset. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.

Players can vote on a point limit between 10,000 and 1,000,000,000 points.

A map limit comes into effect when a map rotation is used. When the last map is ended, a winner is declared,
and the points are recycled.

Points are accumulated in a variety of ways:

*	Damage done to monsters

*	Monster kills (10% bonus of the orginal health of the monster)

*	Extreme death kills (a further 10% bonus of the orginal health of the monster, on top of the kill bonus)
	are when you take the monster's health down to more than negative it's initial health (certain monsters
	explode into gibs)

*	Secrets: Finding a secret first scores 250 points

*	Map Objectives: Finding a key/skullkey first, and using it first scores 250 points. Reaching a level exit
    	first gives 100 points, and reaching a secret level exit first gives 200 points.

*	Map items: Collecting a map item gives +5 points. Any item counted as a map item in Doom, is one that can
	always be picked up, and goes towards the Item Count percentages at intermission screens. Items like blue
	health flasks, armor helmet bonuses, radiation suits, artifact powerups, automap pickups, beserk packs,
	infrared goggles etc... Not armor suits, health pickups, ammo or weapons.

*	Barrels: Barrels give +5 points when destroyed.

*	Chain Bonuses: If a player can kill 4 monsters in a very short time, they will get a small bonus of
	+5 points or more (depending on the monster's starting health), which accumulates up to a +5 or more point
	bonus, for every other monster killed after that, just as quickly. If the player can keep the rampage going,
	they will eventually get a full Chain Bonus of +5 or more points per monster. (NOTE: Any extreme death bonus
	will also be added to the chain bonus score for the killed monster, which essentially doubles the extreme
	death bonus during chain bonuses.

*	'Most' Bonuses: At the end of a level, 100 extra bonus points are awarded to the player which has
	the most monsters killed, has the most items found, has the most secrets found, and has most barrels blown.
	*NOTE*: It is important to pick up barrels and items etc..., since it effects the next score:

*	Monster Infighting Deaths and Monster Suicides: Since monster deaths due to infighting and suicides are ultimately
	player assisted, there is a small bonus for these deaths too. *The player with the total cumulative count of monsters
	killed, items found, secrets found and barrels blown is considered the most active player and gets a full bonus
	of 10% of the orginal health of the monster killed this way.* Other players get a fraction of this score based on the
	ratio of their cumulative count to the leaders. Though even players with 0 will get at least 1 point.

*	Player Deaths: Player deaths due to other players carry no score penalty, though deaths due to monsters, suicide, and
	the environment cary a -1000 penalty (points get set to zero and are never negative).


ScoreDoomST 'Most' Medals

A gold emblazoned 'K', 'I', 'S' and 'B' can show up at the left of the player's name on the intermission/finale
scoreboards. These all signify that the player got a 100 point bonus for each. 'K' = most kills within the level,
'I' = most items picked up within the level, 'S' = most secrets found within the level, 'B' = most barrels blown
within the level. Also note that monster death bonuses due to the environment, suicide &amp; infighting favor players
with the greatest cumulative count in these categories, which can act as a powerup of sorts.
