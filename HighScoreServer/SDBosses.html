Scoredoom Addon Pack Boss Monsters

Custom Boss Monsters

Afrit
Health 1600
Attacks:
1. Fireball: Throws a fireball.
2. Comet: Throws a slower comet.
3. Hellfire: Lays a stream of hellfire down on the floor.
Threat Level: 6
Annoyance Level: 4 (7 if you face him in tight corridors)
Overall Difficulty 5.5
Comment: The best way to take this guy out at is with a super shotgun if you're facing him alone. He takes a good number of rockets to go down due to his immunity to blast damage, and save the bfg for when you're facing him with other enemies.

Annihilator
Health 6000
Attacks:
1. Triple Twin Rockets: Fires three pairs of rockets
2. Triple Twin Homing Missiles: Fires three sets of two homing missiles.
Threat Level: 10
Annoyance Level: 7 (The homing missiles are pretty tough to avoid)
Overall Difficulty: 9.5
Comment: This cyberdemon apparently got one hell of an upgrade. If you run into this guy, hope you have enough cover to deal with his homing missiles should you run into him. If the arena you fight him in has no cover, pray that you have at least either a time freeze sphere to get away from him or a shield sphere to reflect his missiles back at him while you keep pounding away at him with your heavy-hitting weapon of choice and pray you kill him before it wears off.

Arachnophyte
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Super Chaingun: Fires her chaingun at you until either you die or leave her sight.
Threat Rating: 9
Annoyance Rating: 8.5 (Even at a distance, it's tough to avoid the pellets)
Overall Difficulty: 8.75
Comment: Though she has the same chaingun as her land-based counterpart, she's even worse now that she can fly. She can still be taken down with the super shotgun or chaingun if you have sufficient cover, or the bfg if you just want to take her out quickly.

Hellstorm Archon
Health 2000
Attacks:
1. Three-way Fireball Spread: Throws either one or two sets of three fireballs in a spread pattern.
2. Six-way Fireball Spread: Throws six fireballs at once in a spread pattern.
3. Comet: Throws a very fast comet at you.
Threat Level: 9 (10 if you face him in a tight corridor)
Annoyance Level: 4 (no homing attacks)
Overall Difficulty: 7 (he's weaker than the other archon)
Comment: At a distance, the rocket launcher (though he'll take a lot of them), and plasma rifle works best on him. Using the super shotgun on him will also suffice at medium range, but it's very risky because of the comet attack. Bring the bfg if you have to deal with him should he have other enemies with him.

Belphegor
Health 2000
Attacks:
1. Single Fireball: Throws a single fireball.
2. Triple Fireball: Throws three fireballs in a row
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 5 (He can trick you with his triple fireball attack)
Overall Difficulty: 8
Comment: A supershotgun (if you're good at dodging his triple fireball attack), a rocket launcher, or a plasma rifle will suffice against this guy. Whip out the bfg against this guy if he brought friends with him.

Bruiser Demon
Health: 3000
Attacks:
1. Big Fireball: Chucks a big fireball at you.
2. 7-way Fireball Spread: Shoots seven fireballs that fan out in a spread. Sometimes, he can throw two at a time.
3. Ground Explosion Attack: Throws three explosion trails that fan out from in front of him. Especially deadly in tight corridors
Threat Level: 9
Annoyance Level: 7 (9.5 in a tight corridor)
Overall Difficulty: 8.75
Comment: Supershotgun is not gonna help against this guy, as his ground explosion attack can easily obliterate you, especially if you have no armor. Using the plasma rifle on him when it's just him works fine, or the bfg if you're really desparate. It's not a bad idea to use the bfg on him if he has other tough enemies with him.

Cyber Mastermind
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Chaingun/Rocket Launcher Combo: Fires both his super chaingun and his rocket launcher at the same time until you leave his sight.
Threat Level: 10 (The worst of both the Cyberdemon and the Spider Mastermind in one package)
Annoyance Level: 10 (That may be an understatement if you fight him without cover whatsoever, especially in a small arena.)
Overall Difficulty: 10
Comment: If you fight this guy without cover, pray that your bfg (altfire or not) will take him out before his combo attack tears you a new one. Making him infight with splash damage-immune enemies is a good alternative if you want to soften him up without using any ammo.

Spider Demolisher
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Twin Chainguns: Constantly fires at you with his two super chainguns.
2. BFG Cannon: Shoots a bfg ball at you from his main cannon, sometimes TWO.
Threat Level: 10 (Twin chainguns and a bfg cannon? How much worse can this guy get?)
Annoyance Level: 9 (That's without cover)
Overall Difficulty: 9.5
Comment: This guy makes the spider mastermind looks like a pushover. If you can't find any cover, whip out the bfg if you have it then go to town on him and pray that he doesn't use his first.

Hell's Fury
Health: 2000
Attacks:
1. Fireball: Throws a fireball at you.
2. Skull Seekers: Throws three homing skull missiles from his head.
Threat Level: 7
Annoyance Level: 5.5
Overall Difficulty: 6.25
Comment: Only slightly harder than the baron of hell, either the super shotgun or rocket launcher will take him down well enough if it's him alone. In groups, just whip out the bfg.

Lord of Heresy
Health: 2000
Attacks:
1. Fireball: Throws a single fireball.
2. Double Fireball: Throws thee sets of two fireballs a-la the mancubus.
3. Triple Fireball: Throws three fireballs in a three-way pattern.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 6 (the double and triple fireball attacks can be rather tricky to see coming.)
Overall Difficulty: 7
Comment: Same strategies apply to this guy as a regular baron of hell, but stand back a bit so you can evade both the double and triple fireball attacks. (though he's much more likely to hit his own allies accidentially.) This guy is not immune to blast damage, so use your rockets on him if you want.

Warlord of Hell
Health: 2000
Attacks:
1. Fireball: Throws a fireball at you.
2. Twin Fireball Attack: Throws two sets of fireballs at you once his health reaches a certain point, three if he's almost dead.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 5
Overall Difficulty: 7.25
Comment: If you want to keep your distance from this guy, and you should, the rocket launcher works best on him (10-12 should do it). The super shotgun works fine, just be careful once he starts throwing multiple fireballs.

Archon of Hell
Comment: Despite having different sprites, he's pretty much the same as the above hellstorm archon behavior-wise... other than his death animation. The same strategies apply as well to this guy as the aforementioned relative.

Cybruiser
Health: 2000
Attacks:
1. Triple Missile Attack: Fires three missiles at you in rapid succession a-la the cyberdemon.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 5
Overall Difficulty: 7.25 (He's like a weaker cyberdemon)
Comment: His missiles do not home in on you, so you should be fine with fighting him with the strong weapon of your choice in a wide open space. (in tight spaces, that's a different story.) In groups, use the bfg if you want to get rid of them quickly.

Chaingunner Tank
Health 1600
Attacks:
1. Twin Chainguns: Fires its twin chainguns to try to turn your body into swiss cheese.
2. Rocket Attack: Shoots a rocket from the stinger tail
3. Shrapnel: This will fly all over the room once the tank blows up.
Threat Level: 8 (7 if in open spaces)
Annoyance Level: 7.5 (the shrapnel's the only really annoying part.)
Overall Difficulty: 8
Comment: Do not be near this guy when he explodes, as the shrapnel will wreck your armor and health. The rocket launcher and plasma rifle work fine against this guy if he's by himself. Packed in with groups, the shrapnel can damage other enemies as well.

Azanigin (Or Mother Demon)
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Big Comet: Chucks two big comets at you.
2. Mini Comets: Fires a swarm of mini homing comets.
3. Demon Summoning: Summons four demons to assist her. She also does this as she dies.
Threat Level: 9.25
Annoyance Level: 8.5
Overall Difficulty: 9
Comment: The demons she summons aren't too bad (they're just pinkies), but the huge comets she chucks are a force to be reckoned with. The small comets are also very annoying if you fight her in tight spaces, especially without cover. The super shotgun, if you're good at dodging into cover, won't be too bad against her. Use the bfg if you want to take her out quickly... just watch out for the comets.

Apprentice
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Charge Attack: Charges at you, though you can slow him down when he does that with either the chaingun or plasma rifle.
2. Fire Trail Attack: Sends out a a dozen explosive fire trails to attack everything around him when he slams one of his hammers into the ground (he slams the other one right after that in case you dodged the first salvo). The openings between them are wider the further away you are from him, though they slither about.
3. Hammer Shots: Fires three potent fireballs from each of his hammers.
Threat Level: 9
Annoyance Level: 7.5 (The fire trails can wreck not only you, but other enemies as well... but mostly you if you fight him alone)
Overall Difficulty: 8.75
Comment: Getting in close range with this guy is suicide. It's recommended that you keep your distance from him with the plasma rifle or, if you want to take him down quickly, use the bfg and pray that takes him out quickly.

Hellsmith
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Charge Attack: Same deal as his apprentice, only this guy's invulnerable when he does this.
2. Fire Trail Attack: Same as the apprentice, only he sends out twice as many of them. (24 per hammer + two hammers = 48 of those fire trails. Ouch!)
3. Hammer Shots: Same as the apprentice, only the shots his hammer shoots not only hurt more, but they fragment into multiple explosions upon impact. You really do not want to get hit by any of these
4. Pentagram Shield: He uses this whenever he flinches. Especially annoying if you get your own bfg ball deflected back at you. 
Threat Level: 10
Annoyance Level: 10 (His shield attack will make you tear your hair out, if his other attacks don't do it first.)
Overall Difficulty: 10
Comment: If you need someone who really could use the bfg's alt-fire (that costs 400 cells, by the way), it's this guy. If you try to take this guy on with the super shotgun, pray that you have quad damage's effect still active on you (the time freeze sphere is also great if you want to unload as much damage on him before he shields himself or if you just want to get away from him if you can).

Thamuz
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Green Rocket Salvo: Fires ten green rockets in rapid succession.
2. Ground Fire Nova: Summons a fairly large number of green fire missiles that shortly afterwards fan out from him in a circle pattern. He's invulnerable while performing this attack, though it's easy to avoid.
3. Homing Plasma Ball: Shoots a homing plasma ball.
Threat Level: 9 (Without armor, that homing plasma ball has a good chance of killing you instantly, even at full health
Annoyance Level: 9.5 (him always turning invincible, even temporarily, when he does the fire nova attack is REALLY annoying.)
Overall Difficulty: 9.25
Comment: Another very tough cyberdemon variant. If you plan on fighting this towering terror, make sure the arena you fight him in has plenty of cover, especially from that homing plasma ball of death.

Balor
Health: 3000
Attacks:
1. Comet: Throws an explosive comet.
2. Summon lost soul: Summons a lost soul to attack you.
3. Explosive Rocks: Throws three rocks on the ground, then sets them off shortly thereafter.
4. Death Explosion: He explodes upon death.
5. Teleport: Teleports about annoyingly often.
Threat Level: 8.25
Annoyance Level: 9 (His teleportation habit is VERY annoying.)
Overall Difficulty: 8.5
Comment: Use your hard-hitting weapon of choice, then be prepared to chase him down often as he teleports about... just be careful when you finally take him out, as he can take you down with him with his death explosion.

Infernux Grand
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Ground Torpedos: Slams his hoof into the ground to send a torpedo your way.
2. Shockwave: Stomps on the ground to send out a shockwave.
3. Laser Bolts: Fires two laser bolts
4. Proximity Mines: Shoots out proximity mines.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 10 (mostly because of those mines)
Overall Difficulty: 9
Comment: You'll have to be very quick on your feet and have a plasma rifle for this guy. If you have the super shotgun and at least the double damage, the time freeze sphere, and shield sphere powerups active, go to town on him before the invincibility runs out.

Avatar
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Fireball Stream: Fires a long stream of fireballs.
2. Big Energy Ball: Chucks a large, blue energy ball that fragment into smaller energy balls, which in turn fragment into smaller energy balls.
3. Thunder Wave: Fires three thunder pillars similar to Daedolon's Arc of Death spell.
4. Soul Shot: Fires a holy missile similar to Parias' wraithverge.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 4.5 (he's not so bad compared to the other boss monsters)
Overall Difficulty: 6.75
Comment: He's a breather compared to the other bosses. If you have the super shotgun, feel free to plug away at him if it's just him by himself. (He flinches often from point-blank blasts, interrupting his spells which take a while to cast.) The only two spells you really need to worry about him getting off are the energy ball and soul shot spells.

Thor
Health: 1600
Attacks:
1. Ground Lightning: Sends three ground-hugging lightning trails that follow you about, not damaging you until they stop moving and then erupt.
2. Fire Jets: Shoots fire jets from his staff.
3. Fire Bolt: Shoots a big fire bolt from his staff.
4. Force Field: Surrounds himself with a pentagram field of energy geysers that erupt from the tips.
Threat Level: 6 (he flinches fairly often if you decide to get him with the chainsaw)
Annoyance Level: 8 (he can become invincible fairly often)
Overall Difficulty: 6.5
Comment: I don't have much to say about this guy, other than if you want to make a baron kill chain, kill this guy first if he's in a group of baron-level monsters. Otherwise when he's alone, use your favorite weapon against him.

Darkness Rift
Health: 3000
Attacks:
1. Shadow Balls: Shoots several shadow balls.
2. Shadow Bolts: Shoots two shadow bolts at you.
3. Monster Summon: Spawns a monster every once in a while.
Threat Level: 7
Annoyance Level: 8 (This thing can spawn monsters)
Overall Difficulty: 7.5
Comment: The quickest ways to take this thing out without using the bfg is the rocket launcher and plasma rifle. Don't get too close to it as it will damage you.

Cyberbaron
Health: 2000
Attacks:
1. Rocket Launcher: Shoots one rocket with his rocket launcher arm.
Damage: High to Very High
2. Fireball: Chucks a fireball with his still-organic arm.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 6
Overall Difficulty: 7.5
Comment: Not much different from a cybruiser, though his single rocket hurts more. Just don't be near a wall when you dodge his rockets and take him out with any strong weapon of your choice.

Pyro Demon
Health: 3000
Attacks:
1. Explosive fireballs: Throws one or two sets three explosive fireballs.
2. Comet Rain: Rains comets over your head.
3. Explosive Teleportation: Teleports close to you, then generates an explosion when he reappears.
4. Pyro Blast: Shoots a fireball that explodes into many little fireballs.
Threat Level: 9
Annoyance Level: 9 (He teleports often like the balor)
Overall Difficulty: 9
Comments: This guy is a real problem, especially in tight spaces. Use the plasma rifle or the bfg to take him down quickly before he turns you into marine flambe.

Bormereth
Health: 1600
Attacks:
1. Fireballs: Throws three fireballs in a row or three in a spread pattern.
2. Homing Fireball: Charges up a powerful homing fireball before flinging it at you from his mace.
3. Fire Shield: He surrounds himself with five pillars of fire when he flinches. He's invincible while the pillars are up.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 9 (another enemy that shields himself often.)
Overall Difficulty: 8.5
Comment: Use strong single-hit weapons to take this guy out. Rapid-fire weapons? That'll make him more likely to shield himself and waste more ammo in the process.

Azazel
Health: 3000
Attacks:
1. Red Missile Attacks: Fires out non-homing but powerful red missiles.
2. White Missile Attacks: Shoots quick, homing skull missiles at you, occasionally shooting a stronger skull missile.
3. Ground Energy Waves: He emits those whenever he flinches, and they can quickly rip right through everything in their path.
Threat Level: 9.5
Annoyance Level: 9.25
Overall Difficulty: 9.25
Comment: Use strong single-hit weapons on this guy, as rapid-fire weapons are a very bad idea against him. (You don't want to deal with a crapload of those energy waves, right?)

Terminator
Health: 2500
Attacks:
1. Blaster Ball: Fires an explosive blaster.
2. Red Star Missile: Shoots a red homing energy ball.
3. Machine Gun: Fires from his machine gun arm.
4. Energy Grenade: Fires an extremely powerful red energy grenade.

Desolator
Health: 2500
Attacks:
1. Desolation Balls: Shoots three powerful fireballs that explode into a lot of little fireballs.
2. Desolation Bolts: Shoots weaker fireballs.
3. Little Fireballs: He sheds mini fireballs whenever he's hurt, which fly into random directions.
Threat Level: 7
Annoyance Level: 5
Overall Difficulty: 6.25
Comment: This beast can be a real problem in tight spaces. The best way to take it out effectively is with a rocket launcher from a safe distance so you're not too close to him when lets loose several scattered fireballs when he kicks the bucket.

Supreme Fiend
Health: 4000
Attacks:
1. Remote Bombs: Sends a swarm of remote bombs after you.
2. Red Plasma: Fires short bursts of red plasma your way.
3. Bfg Ball: Fires a blue bfg ball.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level 9.5 (The remote bombs can be a real problem)
Overall Difficulty: 8.75
Comment: Think of this guy as a flying version of the spider demolisher... without the chainguns, thankfully. The remote bombs are best detonated from a safe distance when they're clustered together.

Big Infernal Spider
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Spider Spawner: Spawns spiders. Enough said.
2. Fireballs: Shoots three fireballs.
3. Super Flame Shot: Shoots a fire-trailing fireball.
Threat Level: 7
Annoyance Level: 8 (He's really fast)
Overall Difficulty: 7.5
Comment: Use the bfg to take down this eight-legged monstrosity quickly. For the leftovers it might have spawned, take them out as you see fit.

Overlord
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Hades Sphere Swarm: Spits out a small swarm of hades spheres.
2. Storm Shot: Shoots a lightning sphere that shoots lighting bolts out from the sides.
3. Thunder Strike: Sends down lightning bolts that deal a lot of damage to whatever gets in their way.
4. Fireball Swarm: Shoots a large swarm of fireballs.
Threat Level: 7.5 (No homing attacks, thankfully)
Annoyance Level: 8.5 (tends to teleport quite a bit, though)
Overall Difficulty: 8.25
Comment: Any heavy-hitting or rapid-fire weapon will work fine against him if you have enough space... just don't get too close to him. When you see those lightning pillars, stay the hell away from them. One more thing, take out any hades spheres he spawns first, as they WILL get in the way as you try to plug this gas bag.

Dark Cardinal
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Green Rockets: Shoots two green rockets.
2. Magic Plasma: Shoots several plasma bolts at you.
3. Plasma Nova: Shoots out a nova of plasma balls every time he "flinches", some of which will home in on you.
4. Summon Paingasm: Summons a paingasm to take you out.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 8.25
Overall Difficulty: 8
Comment: Considering this guy doesn't have a homing plasma ball of death, taking him out with the bfg quickly wouldn't be a bad idea.

Inferno Demon
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Inferno Bomb: Shoots a firebomb similar to the Pyrodemon's pyro blast, only it spreads out into a buttload of magma balls.
2. Meteor Attack: Calls a meteor to rain onto your head.
3. Fire Glyph: Conjures up a fire glyph beneath your feet to explode shortly after you hear the chime.
4. Magma Ball/Comet combo: Fires either magma balls or comets from his six hands.
5. Ground Flame Attack: Sends ten ground-hugging fire trail attacks in your direction, in two sets of five.
6. Death Sequence: Just don't be near him when you finally kill him.
Threat Level 8 (he's NOT immune to blast damage)
Annoyance Level: 9 (Only in tight spaces. 5 in open areas)
Overall Difficulty: 8.25
Comment: The most efficient way to get rid of him is the rocket launcher because of his lack of immunity to blast damage. The bfg's alt-fire will take him out in one shot, but be sure to keep a safe distance (or quickly find some cover, or better yet, both) before you try it.

Moloch
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Nail Stream: Shoots a stream of nails that rip through anyone they touch.
2. Infernal Grenades: Shoots a cluster of highly-damaging grenades that erupt into fireballs after exploding.
3. Soul Spit: Shoots a few unholy souls out of his mouth that seek you out and rip you to shreds.
4. Thunder Sphere: Spits out a nasty thunder sphere that severely damages you.
5. Pain Wave Attack: Similar to Azazel's, except these don't go through you. They still hurt, though.
6. Earthquake Attack: He does this as a last-ditch effort to take you with him. Stay far away when he does that.

Profane One
Health: 1500 (2000?)
Attacks:
1. Poison Balls: Slings six poison balls.
2. Blood Vomit: He vomits blood... so yeah. It's pretty lethal, though.
3. Resurrection: He can bring back enemies from the dead like the Archvile.
Threat Level: 7
Annoyance Level: 7
Overall Difficulty 7
Comment: Just take him down with your heavy-hitting weapon of choice or the plasma rifle. Save that bfg for when you encounter him in groups with other baron-class enemies.

Executioner
Health 2000
Attacks:
Plasma Stream: Shoots a stream of red plasma at you.
Fragment Grenades: Shoots several frag grenades
Threat Level: 9 (because of the grenades alone)
Annoyance Level: 7
Overall Difficulty: 8.5
Comment: At least he isn't invulnerable when he's firing anymore. However, you should really be careful around those grenades.

Guardian Demon
Health: 2500
Attacks:
Fireball Stream: Shoots a stream of fireballs.
Detonator Cluster: Shoots a cluster of thermal detonators similar to a catharsi's.
Flame Breath: Breathes out a lethal stream of fire that will rip through you.
Threat Level: 7
Annoyance Level: 4 (doesn't attack often and moves slowly)
Overall Difficulty: 6.5
Comment: This fiend's fire breath is especially hard to avoid in tight corridors, so take him out with any weapon in an open area... just don't take those detonators lightly either.

Superdemon
Health: 4000
Attacks:
Triple Fireball Attack: Fires three fireballs in a row at a slightly faster rate than the cyberdemon.
Threat Level: 8
Annoyance Level: 6
Overall Difficulty: 7.75
Comment: Deal with this guy the same way you would with the cyberdemon, only you have to react much more quickly when he fires at you.

Scourge
Health: 6000
Attacks:
1. Railgun Attack: Shoots two strong railgun shots.
2. Machinegun Attack: Fires its twin machine guns until you leave its sight.
3. Flamethrower: A nasty flamethrower attack, it fires that if you get too close to him. It, as you can imagine, will cremate you in seconds.
4. Rocket Attack: Shoots three sets of two really lethal homing rockets. When it fires those, take cover quickly.
Threat Level: 10
Annoyance Level: 10
Overall Difficulty: 10
Comment: Among one the hardest bosses, this monstrosity will obliterate you if you so much as remain within its sight for a second. Shoot and hide is the most effective approach against him.
