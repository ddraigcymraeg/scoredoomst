<pre style="color: rgb(156, 156, 222); font-size: 9pt;">

Afrit
HP: 1600
Danger: 4-6/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Melee Attack: He hits for 10-100 damage. (If he does melee at all)
2. Afrit Ball: Same damage as the baron fireball
3. Comet: An easily-avoidable comment that hits for up to 168 damage (5-40 + 128) on a direct hit.
4. Hellfire: This attack can be a problem in tight spaces, as despite having short range, it can quickly whittle away your health and armor. (I'm not sure if it does 2-16 damage per tic)
Comment: This guy can be a nightmare to fight in tight spaces. In open areas, provided no other enemies (besides other afrits) assist him, he's not too bad.

Agathodemon
HP: 600
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: This one can chew on you for 12-120 damage. Good grief!
2. Fancy Fireball: This one deals 9-72 damage if it hits you, and at least that doesn't home in on you.
3. Homing Fireballs: Shoots a set of two homing fireballs that deal 3-24 damage each.
Comment: The one saving grace to this guy is at least he's not invincible when in stealth mode... though he'll still be pretty tough to see.

Agaures
HP: 200
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 4-40 damage.
2. Fireballs: 4-32 damage, with the faster fireballs being shot off to the sides.
3. Death Breath: Rips through you at a rate of 1-8 damage per tic, and he can pull it off if you're too close to him.
Comment: The breath attack's the only nasty attack he has, as it can take off a large chunk of your health if you give him the chance to use it. (the breath attack has a limited range, though, hence why he uses it mostly up close.) Two normal (read: without double or quad damage) railgun shots, a direct rocket hit (or two) or one-two point-blank super shotgun blasts will put this creep down the quickest. His fireballs aren't too bad to avoid either, though he can throw three of them at a time sometimes. (my memory's a little hazy on this guy)

Amachotron
HP: 550
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Twin Plasma Attack: Same damage, only at double the firing rate.
Comment: He's an arachnotron with twice the firing rate, but only with an extra 50 hitpoints. He can also be pretty dangerous for the other enemies as well, unless you're using the no infighting mode that is. Rockets/grenades can take this guy out quickly, as he's pretty easy to hit and, like pretty much like the arachnotron and his relatives, isn't immune to splash damage.

Annihilator
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10 (twice the rockets means twice the pain)
Annoyance: 10/10 (lethal homing missiles, anyone?)
Attacks:
1. Triple Twin Rocket Barrage: Fires three sets of two rockets in erratic patterns much like the Mancubus. Those rockets hit for the same amount of damage (148-288) as yours do.
2. Triple Homing Missile Salvo: These missiles tend to come right after the above rocket attack, and while they deal 138-208 damage upon hitting their mark, they are a pain in the ass to avoid because of their speed. On top of that, he also fires them in three sets of two; if you don't have a hiding space when the Annihilator gets these off, you're boned.
Comment: This bastard's the one I dread fighting in wide-open areas. If you have enough BFG ammo to use a nuke on this guy, and you have at least quad damage on you (provided you have enough space to avoid getting damaged yourself) USE IT! Otherwise, run... and if he fires three sets of two homing rockets, chances are he'll have the damned homing missiles coming up right after that first barrage.

Arachnobaron
HP: 1000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Ball Spread: Shoots several arachnotron plasma balls in a spread that deal the same 5-40 damage per ball.
2. Arachnobaron Fireball: This deals 136-192 damage on a direct hit, and he's quick to fire them off. Ouch!
Comment: The large plasma balls are pretty fast and deal huge damage if they hit you, and he also has a plasma spread attack that comes out pretty fast. Use rockets on this guy if you want to take him down quickly.

Arachnophyte
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10 (essentially the floating spider mastermind...)
Annoyance: 8.5/10 (...only it's also somewhat more resistant to pain)
Attacks:
1. Super Gatling Gun: Like the Spider Mastermind, her chaingun deals 9-45 (essentially the same damage range as the shotgun mook) and she will relentlessly fire until she flinches or the target hides/dies.
2. Death Explosion: Not really an attack, but when she blows up, you do NOT want to be near her when it happens or you'll suffer the same damage as a barrel popping in your face.
Comment: This one's a little nastier than the regular spiderdemon because of her gift of flight, and the super chaingun is just as nasty as ever. If you don't have the invulnerability, duck and cover mastery against this monster when she gets ready to shoot you is a must, as she is less likely to flinch. Her explosion also damages you if you're too close once she goes down, so be careful.

Arachnorb
HP: 350
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Bolt Swarm: Shoots a swarm of weaving bolts that deal 3-24 damage per bolt.
2. Bite: 6-60 damage.
Comment: Shoots a small line of missiles (dunno if they home in or not), and moves fairly slowly. Not much else, really. Any weapon against this guy will do nicely. (except the pistol)

Arachnotron
HP: 500
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Comment: Rocket launcher's the fastest way to take this guy down, if you're into scoring kill chains, that is. Its plasma bolts are just as damaging as the ones the player uses, though, so be careful.

Archon of Hell/Hellstorm Archon
HP: 2000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Three-way Fireball Spread: Sometimes, there's the off-chance that one of the fireballs in said spread will deal the baron's normal 8-40 damage, with the others dealing half that amount.
2. Six-way Fireball Spread: Six baron fireballs shot at once, and if you can't duck, it's very difficult to dodge in tight spaces.
3. Comet: In addition to being really fast, this comet deals 68-96 damage on a direct hit. It can still severely damage you without armor from full health, though.
4. Melee: 10-100 damage per claw, making meleeing him a no-go.
Comment: Though they have different sprites, they behave the exact same way. A few minor differences between the two would've made them stand out more at least. Both of these guys have a comet attack that hits hard, and throw out fireballs like crazy... though in rather tight spreads. The Archon of Hell doesn't leave a corpse upon biting it, though.

Archvile
HP: 700
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Comment: Not only can he revive fallen enemies, he can also roast you in a few hits (up to 80 damage) at 200% without armor with his instant-hit explosion attack if you're too slow to hide before he completes the attack animation. (the attack can send you flying as well, knocking you off ledges and potentially into inescapable damaging pits) He's not immune to splash damage, so using rockets against him isn't a bad idea... if you can hit him that is. (He's pretty fast, by the way... though he stands still when he's doing the flame attack)

Dark Archvile
HP: 1000
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Flame Pillar: Same Archvile attack.
2. Shadow Shot: Shoots a splitting image of itself that deals 15-120 damage upon hitting you directly, and it's a bitch to avoid.
3. Blood Missile: He shoots a small swarm of blood missiles as his hands glow red, with each of those dealing 20-160 damage a missile.
4. Thunder Blast Barrage: These shots deal 20-160 damage per hit upon nailing you, so be careful.
5. Darkness Ball: Same 20-160 damage.
6. Dark Comets: These deal 5-40 damage. (These last two attacks occur only when he's currently pitch black.
Comment: While he no longer becomes invulnerable, killing this guy should still be amongst your top priorities.

Armored Imp
HP: 140
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: I think he deals 20 damage per hit, I'm not sure.
2. Homing Missiles: Shoots a set of two homing missiles that deal 6-48 damage each.
Comment: He's like a lite version of a revenant, but he's still easy enough to take down if you got the super shotgun at point-blank. This guy's missiles, while not as deadly as those of a revenant, can still do some damage in the early levels if you don't have a strong weapon.

Armored Baron
HP: 2000
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 10-100 damage.
2. Flamethrower: The flamethrower attachment on his arm deals 2-16 damage per puff, but has a short range.
3. Fireball: Same 8-64 damage.
Comment: A baron with a short-range flamethrower attack. He's still tougher if you fight him in tight spaces or don't have any of the stronger weapons when (if) you run into him on the earlier levels of a megawad. Rockets and quad damage-powered railgun shots will take him out quickly.

Auger Rifle Zombie
HP: 40
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Auger Blast: A measly 2 damage per tic, but he can still shoot through walls.
Comment: This guy can shoot you through the walls even if he can't see you... not that it makes him any tougher though.

Auto Shotgun Zombie
HP: 90
Danger Rating: 6/10
Annoyance Rating: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Auto Shotgun: The auto shotgun deals 12-36 damage per point-blank shot, and he will not stop shooting until after sixteen shots before he reloads.
Comment: Take full advantage of his reloading periods in case you can't take him out in time before he starts shooting.

Dark Avatar
HP: 6000
Danger Rating: 8/10 (the fireball stream and lightning ball attacks can, and will, flatten you if your dodging's not very good)
Annoyance Rating: 6/10 (the wraithverge-style attack is very annoying if he gets off a shot with it)
Attacks:
1. Three-way Red Lightning Attack: Shoots three arc-of-death shots in a spread pattern that does 15-120 damage, but it's easy to dodge if you have enough room.
2. Wraithverge-Esque Missile: If you're familiar with how the Wraithverge missiles work, then avoiding this should be no problem unless you're in tight quarters. This deals 8-64 damage on contact with the missile itself, and the souls tear off 6-48 health per tic if they catch up with you. If you see him ready this attack (his hands glow grayish-white), either flinch him quickly, or run.
3. Fireball Stream: The fireballs can take off 18-88 damage upon hitting you directly each, and this spell will quickly obliterate you if you get cornered with it.
4. Thunder Ball: You do NOT want to be hit by this thing directly. He shoots out a huge, blue, bfg-style ball that deals an eye-watering 228-928 damage if the thing makes contact with you, as well as dealing up to 64 damage per tic if you're anywhere near it. The ball then breaks into smaller thunder balls which deal 68-96 damage, breaking into even smaller thunder balls; those balls deal 26-40 damage per contact before splitting into tiny thunder balls that deal 10-24 damage upon hitting you before fizzling out completely. Whew, that's a lot of balls!
Comment: Despite thankfully lacking the shield spell of his original counterpart, the Heresiarch, he's still no joke as far as spells are concerned. He does pause for a short while to charge up his spells, with each of his spells indicated by what color his hands are glowing. (i.e. red-orange means he's about to let loose his fireball stream) This guy is practically the only boss you can berserk easily without invincibility if you REALLY want to save ammo (or you just don't feel like using the over-abundant shotgun ammo), though that requires timing when to back away so you don't get a spell to the face.

Azanigin
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10 (the big comets can easily)
Annoyance: 8/10 (she's now capable flying, so its harder to hide from her on high ledges)
Attacks:
1. Big Comet: This attack deals a whooping 173-488 damage upon hitting you directly, which is pretty much instant death without armor.
2. Small Comet Swarm: A bunch of homing comets that deal 3-24 damage per fireball, and yes the damage can add up quickly.
3. Pinky Summon: Conjures up four... pinkies? Ok...
Comment: Her homing comet swarms can really do a number on your health, so make sure you don't have to fight her in a wide-open space without cover. (Being hit by even one of the big comets is a death sentence) She can also summon pinky demons, but those are just cannon fodder. Adopting a shoot and run tactic against her (if you didn't have powerups before facing her, that is) works just fine, though pray you don't have to face her in a wide-open place without cover. What's worse about her in the latest version? She can float off the ground now.

Azazel
HP: 2000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 10/10 (chaingun against this guy is suicide... and here's why)
Attacks:
1. Claw: 8-80 damage.
2. Blood Missile: These are fast, but are rather poor in their tracking ability as well as dealing 4-32 damage each.
3. Ecto Missile: A slower homing missile that hits for 3-24 damage.
4. Ground Fire Counterattack: These ground fireballs rip through you really quickly, at a damage rate of 1-8 per tic; the damage can still quickly add up.
Comment: If his fast missile attacks don't do you in (and they're pretty nasty in their own rights, by the way), his ground wave counterattack if you get him to flinch will, and just one of those floor-hugging fireballs will seriously fuck your health and armor up. On the bright side, if you're not playing the "no infighting" mode, the other enemies can be hurt by these, too. Quad damage-powered (or better yet, quad/doubler combo-powered, meaning each hit will deal eight times the damage) is the quickest way to take him down. Without those, keep as far away from him as possible, and don't try the super shotgun on him either. Direct rocket hits will take him down as well, though you'll need a good number of them as he's (annoyingly) immune to splash damage.

Balor
HP: 3000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 9/10 (He LOVES to teleport)
Attacks:
1. Melee: 10-100 damage per hit.
2. Comet: His own fireball deals 47-152 on a direct hit, and it's pretty fast, too.
3. Mine Trap: Each explosive can take off up to 100 damage in blast damage.
4. Death Throes: In true D&D fashion, he blows up upon dying; say goodbye to up to 150 hitpoints if you're right in his face when he finally kablooms.
Comment: Not only is his mine trap attack and his fireballs very damaging, he also teleports about very often, making him a major pain in the ass to fight. He also explodes upon death, so don't be too close when he finally falls. A few quick but careful point-blank direct hits to him with the bfg will end this dolt the quickest (though you still might end up taking damage when he explodes), but killing him with the super shotgun without a damage multiplier powerup... have fun chasing him down as he teleports all over the place... and well his mine trap attack.

Baphomet
HP: 8000
Danger: 11/10 (If you have at least 400 cells and a BFG, USE THE NUKE ALT-FIRE!!! I really can't stress this enough)
Annoyance: 8/10 (at least he's only in boss rushes)
Attacks:
1. Scorcher Missile: These missiles are not only extremely fast, but they deal 200-500 damage, meaning almost a one-hit-kill with 200% health and armor WITHOUT the damage-reducing powerups.
2. Scorcher Nova: Shoots out more of those scorcher missiles everywhere.
3. Demon Summon: Like the icon of sin,
Comment: Ugh, this guy... not only does he have the highest health of all the monsters in the bestiary (only 2000 more hp than the rest of the megaboss-class monsters), his super-fast fire missiles can also obliterate you with one hit. On the bright side though, he doesn't move at all (though that can be a kick to the nuts in the 100% kills department if he spawns in those monster boxes where enemies can teleport in), but even that doesn't make him any easier. He can also summon a bunch of enemies at once, ranging anywhere from the standard imp variants to those brutal miniboss enemies. If you want to really end this fucker quickly (not that I will blame you, in that case), then you need the shield sphere and both damage powerups active, as well as the bfg with enough ammo to use the nuke alt-fire.

Baphomet's Eyes
HP: 100
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10 (7/10 for the green eyes)
Attacks:
Red Eye: It explodes, dealing up to 100 damage.
Brown Eye: Spawns spiders upon death.
Green Eye: Spawns a slew of poison clouds that can quickly choke you to death with poison damage.
Comment: While the red and brown ones explode and release spiders respectively, it's the green ones with the poison vapor attack that can quickly take you out if you're too close to them (for some reason) when they detonate.

Baron of Hell
HP: 2000
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Comment: In this mod, he's a bigger meat shield than usual. Some of his other relatives (like the Archon of Hell for instance) make him look wimpy in comparison, as he only has that lousy fireball attack. He's only effective in tight quarters though.

Belphegor
HP: 2000
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Triple Fireball: Throws three fireballs in a row that deal 10-80 damage per hit.
2. Melee Strike: A bat from the claw deals 15-150 damage per hit.
Comment: The triple missile attack can catch you off guard if you're not careful. Other than that, he's not too bad as he's not immune to rocket splash damage... though he's a bit more damaging so be careful. (especially in melee, where he can kill you in a few hits without armor)

BFG Commando
HP: 60
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 3/10 (though that CAN change depending on the situation)
Attacks:
1. BFG Ball: Will very likely kill you instantly on a direct hit; if you don't survive it, the tracers will kill you.
Comment: If you see this guy, take him down immediately as his bfg he has some major one-shot-kill potential stacked against you. On the plus side, he does drop it for you to pick up when you knock him down. (one railgun shot minimum takes him out)

Black Widow
HP: 700
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Homing Plasma Bolt: 3-24 damage per hit, enough said.
2. Pulse Projectile: Shoots a constant stream of ripping projectiles that deal 2-16 damage per tic, whittling your health down very quickly.
Comment: The pulse rail attack can quickly tear you to pieces if you let it shoot you with it, so use rockets on it to take it out quickly.

Blood Fiend
HP: 180
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: Like their pink cousins, their bites do 4-40 damage.
2. Blood Spit: Shoots two closely-packed blood bolts that hit for 2-16 damage per bolt.
Comment: The blood projectiles he spits do a rather small bit of damage, but they're pretty fast. Comes with a semi-invisible variant as well.

Blot
HP: 50
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Touch Damage: It takes away 3 health per tic.
Comment: This thing can drain your health quickly if you get too close to it, and it's good at chasing you down; it's nothing that a shotgun blast won't take care of, though.

Bruiser Demon
HP: 3000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Melee: This bastard hits for 20-200 points of damage if you're unlucky (or stupid) enough to get right into his grille.
2. Big Fireball: A very fast fireball that hits for 16-128 damage upon contact.
3. Small Fireball Spread: The Bruiser Demon hurls two sets of seven smaller fireballs in a rather wide arc. Each of these deal 8-64 damage like a regular baron fireball would upon hitting you or the enemies (assuming you didn't have No-Infighting mode on for the latter case)
4. Ground Explosion Trail Spread: This attack right here is a doozy in tight spaces! He shoots three sets of ground explosion trails that deal up to 50 damage per explosion. What's worse is that the damage will very quickly stack up.
Comment: His three-way ground explosion attack is a nightmare to avoid in tight spaces, so avoid going down those narrow hallways if he's around (especially if those lead to a dead end, as that attack is a death sentence if he uses it on you there.) Not even objects will help against that attack, so hiding behind walls is highly recommended. (The ground attack can even hit you from all the way across the map, regardless if you're higher up than he is.)

Burning Soul
HP: 100
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: 3-24 damage.
Comment: This soul's missile attack isn't too bad to avoid, and it doesn't do much damage. You should still be careful when it charges, though.

Cacodemon
HP: 400
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Comment: His cousins pretty much make him look easy... well, except for some of them like the next one on this list.

Doom 3 Cacodemon
HP: 300
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 4-40 damage.
2. Fireball: This deals 8-64 damage, but it's destructible.
Comment: Despite being faster than the above cacodemon, this guy's fireballs can be destroyed, making him a pushover.

Cacoelemental
HP: 400
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Comment: This brown caco can spit out mini cacos that are much more easily defeated than the lost souls. (15 hp of a mini caco compared to the 100 hp of the lost soul)

Cacolantern
HP: 500
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: Deals 6-60 damage up close.
2. Fireball: Shoots a blistering-fast fireball that hits for 9-72 damage. Quite a step up from the regular cacodemon, since he fires them pretty fast, too.
Comment: He's pretty quick to fire his nasty fireballs, but it's still rather easy to stunlock him with the chaingun's altfire.

Cacolich
HP: 450
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Homing Eye Blast: This slow fireball hits for 7-56 damage if you let it hit you.
2. Flame Breath: This attack you really have to watch out for, since it can deal a minimum of 5 damage per tic. The damage adds up very quickly, and it has a somewhat decent range on top of that.
Comment: His homing eye blasts may not seem like much, but it's his breath attack that will mutilate your health levels if you let it. It's pretty slow movement-wise, though.

Chaingun Major
HP: 140
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Chaingun: Just like the regular chaingunner damage-wise, only slightly faster.
Comment: He has a slightly higher rate of fire and twice as much health as a regular chaingunner, making him more painful to deal with if you can't kill him fast enough.

Chaingunner
HP: 70
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Comment: Like in the original game, two or more of these guys will spell a quick death if you let them start firing.

Chaingun Spider
HP: 450
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Chaingun: Same damage as the chaingunner, only he's got more health on him... albiet not as healthy as an arachno.
Comment: This guy's an arachnotron with a chaingun instead, basically. He can still destroy your health if you're too slow to hide.

Chainsaw Zombie
HP: 30
Danger: 1/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attack:
1. Chainsaw: Deals 1-10 damage per tic upon getting within range, and it can add up quickly.
Comment: Despite being slow, his chainsaw can quickly drain your energy if you let him... and because of his health level, you shouldn't have to let it happen. You do get a chainsaw, though.

Charge Demon
HP: 180
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 4-40 damage.
2. Crazy Charge: Homes in on you relentlessly like some of the lost soul relatives, dealing 3-24 damage upon contact.
Comment: His charge attack can quickly clear gaps to get right into your face, so using rockets against him isn't exactly the best idea. The supershotgun's good against him, though.

Crackodemon
HP: 500
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball Spread: A spread of three fireballs that deal 3-24 damage each.
2. Fireball Barrage: Shoots a bigger barrage of fireballs with the same damage per fireball.
3. Soul Blast: Deals 66-80 damage upon a direct hit, and he can pull it out pretty quickly.
Comment: His lost soul missile will dole out major hurt if he gets a direct hit with it, and he will as he has a good chance of doing it when you're too close to him. The multi-ball attack is also rather tough to avoid in tight spaces.

Cyberbaron
HP: 2000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: Same 8-80 damage as a regular baron.
2. Baron Ball: Same baron ball, enough said.
3. Rocket Attack: Same damage as a cyberdemon's rocket, except he shoots one at a time.
Comment: Careful if you meet him in tight spaces. If he lands a direct hit with that rocket of his and you don't have armor, you're pretty much dead. He's very aggressive, too.

Cyberdemon
HP: 6000
Danger: 8/10 (just as nasty as before, despite the stronger replacements)
Annoyance: 6/10 (still has the same pattern as the old vanilla monsters)
Comment: He can still kick your ass, despite having relatives much nastier than he is. Fight him like you normally would in vanilla doom, just keep in mind that he has an extra 2000 hit points here.

Cybruiser
HP: 2000
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Triple Missile Salvo: Three missiles that deal 74-144 points of damage on a direct hit per missile.
Comment: His missiles are weaker, but he can shoot three of those at a time (said rockets are still really nasty on a direct hit) and he lacks the standard baron fireball.

Cyber Mastermind
HP: 6000
Attacks:
1. Rocket-Chaingun Combo: This fiend uses both the Cyberdemon's rocket attack and the Spider Mastermind's gatling gun CONSTANTLY until you hide, die, or flinch it first. (The hitscan bullets and rockets deal the same damage ranges, each)
Danger: 10/10 (two bosses meld into one. Oh, joy!)
Annoyance: 10/10 (will NOT let up when firing)
Comment: Oh boy... the combined might of the cyberdemon and the spider mastermind in one package. If his rockets don't waste you, the super chaingun will, and the rockets and bullets won't stop coming until you hide.

Cyber Imp
HP: 200
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Ball: 5-40 damage.
2. Jump: Can leap right over you head.
Comment: He can shoot with his plasma rifle and he can jump at (or over) you. He can be pretty annoying sometimes, if you're not expecting it.

Cyclo Imp
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Cyclo Dart: This projectile bounces around a lot, but hits for only 2-16 damage on contact.
2. Fireball Flurry: Shoots a decent-sized flurry of imp fireballs pretty quickly.
Comment: The cyclo plasma ball is sometimes pretty tough to dodge in tight areas, and his fireball barrage can quickly tear your health up if you don't dodge it. He's also as hardy as a regular pinky.

Daedabus
HP: 1000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball Spreads: Each fireball deals 12-96 damage, and the last spread makes him shoot off five fireballs. Ouch!
Comment: The damaging fireball spreads he shoots make it pretty tough to get anywhere near him if he gets the chance, so stunlocking him is necessary. He's also immune to splash damage, so rockets won't work so well on him.

Dark Cardinal
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Rockets: Deals the same damage as regular rockets do.
2. Death Plasma Nova: A flurry of homing fireballs are unleashed every time he flinches, with each of them hitting you for 1-8 damage.
3. Plasma Bolts: Non-explosive projectiles that hit for 6-48 damage per shot, and have a fancy trail. That's it.
4. Paingasm Summon: Summons a cacodemon relative known as a paingasm.
Comment: If the (thankfully, non-homing) dark rockets and paingasms it can summon don't do you in (though the dark rockets can pretty easily if they land a direct hit, and the paingasms are only slightly-tougher cacodemons that have a trail effect and a strong fireball), the homing fireball nova every time he "flinches" will, and using the chaingun on him (like the Azazel enemy I mentioned earlier) is a very bad idea. (The fireballs don't deal as much damage individually, but the damage can quickly add up.)

Dark Inquisitor
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Dark Matter Ball: This lethal shot deals 185-290 upon landing a direct hit in your face.
2. Tesla Grenades: This tin titan can shoot these in sets of two, but these drain your health quickly just being in the blast.
Comment: This hellbot is actually fairly easy, but man do its attacks hurt like hell! It can also fly to get over to you quickly.

Lost Soul
HP: 100
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: This guy constantly charges at you, dealing 5-40 damage per hit.
Comment: He explodes upon getting killed, but at least he doesn't blow himself up.

Dark Revenant
HP: 450
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Punch: Same damage as a regular revenant. (6-60)
2. Twin Rockets: He fires a set of two rockets come at you fairly quickly, and deal 6-48 damage a hit.
Comment: The dark revenant's missiles now home in on you, making him potentially twice as bad as a regular revenant. Also, his corpse disappears shortly after you kick his ass.

Dark Vile
HP: 900
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Dark Fire Pillar: Deals up to 30 damage, but it's much faster with exploding.
2. Ice Shard Flurry: This attack is a major pain in the ass, the shards do 1-8 damage each, but he shoots two of those in very rapid succession, killing you quickly.
3. Big Thunderball: He charges up for a big thunderball, then unleashes it upon you. It homes in on you and spawns damaging thunder bolts as it flies. If the ball makes contact with you, it deals a staggering 158-368 upon hitting you directly.
4. Death Throes: Upon finally dying, he has an impressive light show that can be very deadly if you're anywhere near him.
Comment: His nigh-unavoidable ice shard barrage attack can kill you quickly, and his green fire pillar attack is pretty nasty too. The one attack where he charges up for an instant-kill energy sphere takes a while for him to charge before letting it loose so blast him with rockets (splash damage affects him normally, thankfully), otherwise hide as quickly as you can before he gets the sphere off, and make sure your hiding spot is not within the vicinity of the sphere.

Darkness Rift
HP: 3000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Touch Damage: Getting anywhere near this thing deals 1-10 damage per tic, and yes, this damage can quickly add up.
2. Shadow Ball Swarm: Those fireballs deal up to 10 damage each.
3. Dark Spear Attack: A quick dark energy spear attack that deals up to 20 damage per hit.
4. Enemy Summon: This abberation can summon anything from a revenant up to a baron of hell. (Or either a cacodemon or baron of hell in Doom 1)
Comment: This thing can summon tough demons to get in your way, and getting too close to it damages you. It also has a missile swarm that can rip through you, and a quick but lethal darkness shard attack that's pretty hard to see coming. Thankfully, rockets can deal full damage to it.

Deathbringer
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10 (pray that you don't fight him in tight spaces)
Annoyance: 10/10 (can attack very quickly as well, making hit and run difficult)
Attacks:
1. Lightning Shot Spread: A spread of five lightning bolts that deal 6-48 damage per tic individually when ripping through you.
2. Death Energy Ball: A big BFG-esque ball that can kill you with a ludicrous 356-1056 damage on a direct hit. It breaks into lightning shots upon impact as well.
3. Bouncing Plasma Balls: This attack's just weird, he shoots a crapton of rebounding plasma balls that deal 2-16 damage a hit.
4. Weaker Lightning Spread: This deals 4-32 damage instead.
5. Teleport: Just teleports towards your location.
6. Railgun Shot: This deals up to 50 damage upon hitting you, and he's pretty damn accurate with it too.
Comment: Oh boy... this guy sends so much bouncing plasma bolts that entire rooms can pretty much become minefields (though the bolts themselves to minimal to absolutely no damage). He also has a pretty hard-to-dodge (and deadly) rail attack and a few other attacks that will leave you dead if you're too slow to avoid them.

Death Elemental
HP: 600
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Lost Soul Spawn: Summons a few lost souls as one of his attacks.
2. Comet Missile: 5-40 damage per missile, but he can shoot two of those at a time.
Comment: He's worse than the pain elemental as he can summon more lost souls and has a few missile attacks up its two maws. It also summons a last few skull heads upon biting it.

Death Incarnate
HP: 300
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Hook: Each hit from this guy deals 7-70 damage up close
2. Gaze Attack: A surprisingly-weak-but-somewhat-accurate hitscan attack that shoots out three "bullets" that deal 2-6 damage each, totalling at 6-18 if the whole thing hits.
Comment: His gaze attack deals somewhat low damage, but his hooks hit harder, and he can take you down quickly with them if you let him or are stupid enough to try to chainsaw him to death. Thankfully, in this mod, he can't get back up once he's down, and doesn't spawn a hades sphere either.

Decepticon
HP: 500
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Stream: Same 5-40 damage as a regular arachnotron.
2. Railgun Shot: Takes off up to 50 health if it hits, and he's accurate with it.
Comment: He's pretty accurate with that railgun attack, which chops off a good chunk of your health. (I don't know the exact damage)

Defiler
HP: 450
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Skull Ball: Shoots a few homing skulls that hit you for 2-16 damage each.
2. Defiler Shot: This one doesn't home in on you, but it deals 10-80 damage.
3. Death Throes: It spawns more of those homing skulls upon dying.
Comment: This guy can shoot homing lost soul missiles and can revive fallen enemies, so it's best to kill him quickly if you see him. (be careful of one last skull missile barrage when he dies) The lost soul missiles are very slow and deal crap damage individually though. (Yes, the damage can add up)

Demolisher
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10 (twin chainguns and bfg cannon = instant holy crap)
Annoyance: 10/10 (If you have no cover, you're in trouble)
Attacks:
1. Twin Chainguns: Imagine the Spider Mastermind's chaingun and multiply that by two.
2. BFG Shot: If you see him get ready to use this attack, HIDE QUICKLY! What makes this worse, is that he can fire off a second one. The BFG shots deal the same damage as said gun does in your possession. Direct hit and all. (100-800 base damage plus 40 invisible tracers that hit for 49-87 damage individually, for those of you who want to know how much damage the BFG does.)
Comment: Twin super chainguns and a bfg cannon that allows for two shots at a time spells real trouble. If you are really good at taking cover, you won't have much trouble with this monstrosity. If you don't have sufficient weaponry and ammo when you deal with this upgraded Spiderdemon variant, run if you don't have to fight him... not at least without any good powerups.

Pinky Demon
HP: 150
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 4-40 damage per bite, enough said.
Comment: He's supershotgun fodder compared to his tougher relatives.

Demon Dog
HP: 50
Danger: 1/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 4-40
Comment: All this mutt does is bite and jump at you. Enough said.

Desolator
HP: 2000
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Desolator Bullet: 5-40 damage with explosions that deal 1-8 damage.
2. Desolation Bolt: This can take off 10-80 health upon contact, with the explosions dealing the same damage.
Comment: He's especially nasty with his cluster bomb attacks in tight spaces, so a rocket launcher up to a bfg can quickly take this guy out in those areas.

Devastator Zombie
HP: 70
Danger: 10/10 (One bright side to this guy, he can unwittingly help thin out herds of large enemies if he appears among them.)
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Devastator Blast: This guy's weapon makes the bfg look wimpy. The astronomical amount of damage, being 576-2368, means that you definitely WILL die instantly on a direct hit. Holy shit does this guy redefine the term overkill! The smaller balls the main projectile breaks into deal 75-152 damage should one hit you; the lightning bolts deal 15-120 damage upon hitting you as well.

Devil
HP: 80
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball Combo: This guy constantly throws the standard imp fireballs. 'Nuff said.
Comment: A more aggressive imp who can constantly throw fireballs at you, but that doesn't make him any harder.

Diabloist
HP: 800
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Fire Pillar: This one actually damages you as you're caught in the flames, though it deals up to 40 damage.
2. Flame Missile: This one deals 8-64 damage, but it has a limited range.
3. Twin Ground Tracer Attack: This is his most lethal attack, with each tracer dealing 71-120 damage on a direct hit, and they are very persistent in hunting you down.
4. Flare Barrage: This attack has him shooting a barrage of twelve flare bolts. Individually, each of these flares deal 4-36 damage on contact, giving that attack more potential than the flame pillar to quickly drain your health.
Comment: His twin homing trail attack is one you really don't want to be hit by, as it's very tough to avoid it (it can track you all the way through the other side of the map if there aren't any walls/pillars or objects in between their paths) and both of those on a direct hit simultaneously will immolate your ass if you don't have armor. He also has a fire pillar attack that actually hurts you unlike those of the regular archviles along with an attack similar to Parias' firestorm weapon, which also deals big damage if you let it hit you. (it comes out really fast, but has a limited range... though chances are it will do the twin homing trail attack afterwards) This archvile variant, as of the latest version, can now revive other enemies, so kill this guy quickly. The flare barrage attack of his is a tad nastier than the flame pillar, due to being capable of racking up damage.

Drowned Soul
HP: 100
Danger: See burning soul
Annoyance: See burning soul
Attacks:
1. Waterball: Same 3-24 damage.
Comment: Not much different from the burning soul, though the water drop effect's a nice touch.

Dreamcreeper
HP: 125
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: A relentless charge that deals 5-40 damage on contact.
Comment: He can not only teleport about the map in your general area, but he frequently strafes about, making him a pain in the ass to hit... except when he charges at you. He's pretty fast when he charges, too.

Dual Chaingunner
HP: 100
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Dual Chainguns: This guy packs two chainguns, so... well, you get the picture.
Comment: A chaingunner with twice the firepower... wonderful. Anyways, hide from him when he fires (or more preferably, put him down before he starts shooting), or he can easily turn you into kibble with half the effort of the single chaingunners.

Dune Warrior
HP: 90
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Machinegun: Same damage as the regular chaingunner per shot.
2. Rockets: Shoots two rockets.
3. Grenade: Splits into a fireball nova.
Comment: He can turn invisible and reappear to attack with either a rapid-fire rifle or a rocket. (The latter is a very likely one-hit-kill on a direct hit without armor) He can also throw detonators at you sometimes. At least he can be hurt when invisible now.

Enhanced Cacodemon
HP: 300
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: Deals 6-60 damage like the rest of the cacodemon family.
2. Three-Way Fireball Spread: Shoots three fireballs in a spread much like the original Disciple of D'Sparil. Who'd have thought? The fireballs deal the same damage, though.
Comment: This caco's three-way shot pattern's simple to avoid... except in tight spaces.

Etheral Soul
HP: 120
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Shadow Ball: For damage, see the shadow enemy below.
2. Homing Charge: Relentlessly charges at you for 5-40 damage per hit. Ouch!
Comment: While his missiles don't home in on you, he's pretty persistent with his charge attack. He's also invisible until he either gets hit or attacks, but thankfully not invincible.

Evil Doom Guy
HP: 200
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Rifle: Essentially the same firing rate as when you have one of your own. Same damage per ball, too.
2. Rocket: You do not want to get hit by that, especially without armor.
3. Super Shotgun: 75-225 damage at point-blank range, meaning he can potentially one-shot you that way as well.
4. Chainsaw: With 5-50 damage per tic, he can tear you to shreds if you try the chainsaw on him.
Comment: Being hard as hell to hit whilst he's moving, it's best to try to hit him when he's firing his plasma rifle. The upside to fighting him is that he drops the super shotgun, plasma rifle, and rocket launcher as well as a 1000-point-bonus item if you manage take him down.

Fallen
HP: 200
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball Barrage: The standard fireball barrage, only with 2-16 damage per fireball.
Comment: Pretty much the same as the fire gargoyles from Hexen, despite having a different set of sprites. Still somewhat annoying to hit at times, though.

Female Soldier Zombie
HP: 20
Danger: 1/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Carbine Rifle: Same damage as a regular pistol.
Comment: Just as weak as their male counterparts, really.

Female Sergeant Zombie
HP: 30
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Rapid Fire Rifle: Same as a rapid fire trooper.
Comment: Basically a female rapid fire trooper, that's it.

Female Railgun Zombie
HP: 40
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Railgun: Up to 30 damage per hit.
Comment: She's just as bad as her male cohorts, as she can hit you from all the way across the map. The damage is pretty weak, though.

Female Plasma Zombie
HP: 40
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Rifle: Same 5-40 damage.
Comment: Not much tougher than the male plasma rifle dudes.

Flamethrower Zombie
HP: 50
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Flamethrower: This flamethrower takes out 6-13 health per puff, and yes, the damage stacks up.
Comment: The flamethrower can quickly eat up your health if you're close enough.

Flesh Spawn
HP: 50
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: 2-16 damage.
2. Fireball: 2-16 damage.
Comment: It can shoot fireballs like a cacodemon and charge like a lost soul, but it's easily taken down.

Flying Imp
HP: 60
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: 3-24 damage. Enough said.
Comment: This one's not too bad to take down, but there's a worse variant later on in the beastiary... but more on that one later.

Forgotten One
HP: 80
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Homing Charge: Same 3-24 damage, except keeps homing in on you.
Comment: A super shotgun or a railgun shot is efficient enough to take this thing out.

Fox Imp
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 5-50 damage.
2. Fireballs: Shoots either a fireball or three in a spread pattern, with each fireball doing 5-40 damage.
Comment: This guy has stronger missiles, and he can shoot three of them at a time in a spread. Other than that, and he's pinky-durable, that's pretty much it.

Freeze Rifle Zombie
HP: 60
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Freeze Shots: Each of his shots deal 4-32 damage.
Comment: He may be as tough as an imp, but his freeze rifle's not really much stronger than a plasma rifle zombie's... though it is amusing to see him freeze his allies accidentally when not playing "no infighting" mode.

Frozen Imp
HP: 180
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Ice Ball: 6-48 damage, and freezes you if it finishes you off.
Comment: He may be right up there with the pinky-class enemies in the health department, but he shatters upon death.

Fusion Cannon Arachnotron
HP: 600
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Fusion Cannon Blitz: Fires an endless amount of shots that deal the same damage as a plasma shot each.
Comment: He shoots a huge volley of slow missiles that can be surprisingly tough to avoid... and if you're not playing "no infighting" mode, he can very likely hit a lot of his allies in the process. He's essentially a much less insane version of the Insanity Spider... but still pretty nuts.

Gargantus
HP: 750
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Comment: His bouncing plasma shots can deal major damage if just one of them hits you, and they can be pretty hard to avoid sometimes. (My memory's a bit hazy about his other attacks, if he had anymore that was)

Gatekeeper
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10 (It isn't called Gatekeeper for nothing)
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Shadow Machinegun: This attack the gatekeeper shoots from his claw, albiet somewhat rarely.
2. Ring Blast: The Gatekeeper shoots out a series of weird shadow rings that deal 20-160 damage per shot.
3. Big Shadow Ring: The Gatekeeper rears his head up and shoots out a big energy ring that deals 100-800 damage. He makes Moloch look like a pushover.
4. Shadow Laser: This deals an ungodly 600-4800 upon hitting you; not even having both damage reduction powerups will help against this attack should he get you with it.
5. Plasma Grenades: Each of these can kill you really fast on a direct hit, but they do have a fairly limited range.
6. Shadow Flame Breath: Getting right up in this guy's face ensures you a heaping of fire to the face, which can rip your health to shreds.
7. Counterattack Nova: Every time the Gatekeeper flinches, a ring of plasma balls, each of which do 20-180 damage, but they're very well spread out so avoiding them's not that big of an issue.
Comment: The Gatekeeper may be nowhere near as annoying as Moloch, but he is still an extremely powerful boss.

Golem
HP: 700
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 15-150 damage? Melee's risky unless you have a berserk pack.
2. Homing Spike Attack: Shoots out a homing spike pillar that takes off 2-16 damage per tic.
Comment: His homing pillar attack used to be a death sentence back when he was first introduced. Thankfully, now it doesn't deal so much damage... but it can still do a number on you if you let it.

Grief Elemental
HP: 600
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Rictus Missile: Sometimes, he'll shoot one of these, so watch out.
2. Lost Soul Spawn: Shoots out a lost soul like a pain elemental does.
Comment: He can sometimes shoot kamikaze rictus heads at you in addition to summoning lost souls.

Hades Sphere
HP: 35
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Explode: Up to 112 damage upon popping.
Comment: Blows up upon dying unless "gibbed" and is thankfully slow. It can teleport, though.

Hammer Hound
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Shockwave Barrage: This beast generates shockwaves that, at a damage rate of 1-8 per tic and ripping through you, means that getting anywhere near him is suicide. On top of that, rocks drop from the ceiling as well while the attack's going on.
2. Falling Rocks: These very slowly fall on you, dealing 42-112 damage upon impact.
3. Homing Ground Torpedoes: Same damage as the rocks, except these can climb up ledges to reach you.
4. Land Mines: These deal up to 32 damage upon blowing up, but since many of them can be clumped together, they can deal heavy damage simultaneously.
5. Orbit Boulders: These boulders deal up to 40 damage on direct contact, and fragment into smaller deadly rocks
Comment: Lays hard-to-see land mines everywhere when you're not looking, has a ground-hugging homing torpedo attack, and has a shockwave attack that makes it very difficult to get anywhere near him as he can tear your health to shreds. He also leaves a bunch of explosions upon death, so don't get too close.

Hectebus
HP: 1000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball Salvo: Shoots three sets of two green fireballs in a different pattern, with said fireballs doing 16-128 damage individually. Talk about a wake-up call!
Comment: His firing pattern's different from the mancubus, enough to throw players familiar with the brown fatass' firing pattern off. This one isn't immune to splash damage, so rockets work well enough against him.

Hades Elemental
HP: 600
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 8.5/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 10-100 damage. In other words, don't bother meleeing this prick.
2. Fireball Spread: 8-64 damage + five of those hitting you at once = death!
3. Homing Lightning Strike: This attack makes this guy extremely dangerous for his monster class. A three-way homing lightning strike that deals 47-152 damage per hit, and is RELENTLESS when pursuing you, is definitely not fun to get hit by.
4. Hades Sphere Spawn: Summons two Hades Spheres.
Comment: If you can't stop him from getting his thunderbolt attack off, RUN!

Hell Champion
HP: 650
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: 8-64 damage, enough said.
2. Ground Flame Burst: Homes in on you and rips through you for 1-8 damage a tic. The fire trails it leaves damage you as well.
3. Acid Ball: Poisons you for 4-32 damage as well as eating away up to an additional 25 hitpoints.
Comment: He's not much tougher than the regular hell knight, but he's invincible when he's charging up with his annoying homing ground fireball attack. He also has a poison ball attack as well as the standard green missile attack.

Hellfire Soul
HP: 50
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Charge Attack: 1-8 damage? Seriously?
2. Fireball: 3-24 damage.
Comment: Shoots a weak homing missile and becomes a regular lost soul upon dying.

Hell Guard
HP: 300
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Triple Bolt Salvo: Shoots three magic bolts in a row that deal 6-48 damage individually.
Comment: The triple magic bolt attack deals decent damage on average, and he's twice as healthy as a pinky demon.

Hell Hound
HP: 250
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 7-70 damage per bite makes this mutt very dangerous to melee.
2. Flame Breath: Each puff of flame (not counting the non-damaging ones) can deal 2-16 damage, and seeing that he can do a number on your health, a few breath bursts can fry you really fast.
Comment: He's very quick, and comes with a nasty fire breath.

Hellion
HP: 70
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: Deals 8-64 damage. No wonder this guy fires so slowly.
Comment: He's an imp who fires his missiles in an impractically-slow fashion.

Hell Knight
HP: 500
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Comment: Like the baron of hell, his firing pattern's simple... though he shows up more often than the former.

Hell's Battery
HP: 6000 (500 for the second stage)
Danger: 9/10 (He's slow)
Annoyance: 10/10 (Even without invulnerability, he's st)
Attacks:
1. Plasma Chainguns: Shoots two concentrated streams of plasma shots continuously that will very quickly eviscerate you.
2. Aerial Bomb: Falls on you, dealing up to 32 damage upon contact.
3. Three-Way Mortar Shot: This attack's his most brutal one. He shoots three mortars in a spread that cover a lot of space and very quickly rack up the damage.
4. Chaos Rockets: Shoots two rockets that drop lots of bombs as they fly by.
5. Fire Tracer Breath: Goes along the ground, and rips through you for 3-24 damage per tic, leaving fires along the ground as well.
Comment: While he no longer turns invincible, the quake attack when he's readying up his nastier attacks can be devastating. Also, don't be near him when you take out his second form.

Hell's Fury
HP: 2000
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: Throws a red fireball that deals the same damage as a Baron ball. Ok...
2. Triple Homing Skulls: He fires three homing skull balls from his mouth that deal 2-16 damage individually. Overall, a weaker homing attack than his standard fireball.
Comment: Other than the triple homing skull attack, he's not that much different from the standard baron of hell. Nice effect with the falling head, though.

Horn Beast
HP: 650
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Ground Blast: It can take off a big chunk of health if both blasts hit you directly AND you're right in the middle of the flames.
Comment: The ground explosion attack he launches can very easily kill you, so exercise extreme caution around this bastard.

Hellsmith
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10 (He can flatten you in seconds if you're careless, and no, I'm NOT joking)
Annoyance: 10/10 (I recommend nuking this bastard)
Attacks:
1. Hammer Smash: He smashes you to paste for 20-200 damage each hit, and he can combo the shit out of you if you somehow survive the first hit.
2. Invincible Charge: This is the only attack of his where he's temporarily invincible, as of this current version. Still, you do NOT want to be gored by it; it knocks off 30-240 health if it hits you, making that attack pretty much a potential one-shot candidate.
3. Fire Trail Nova: This attack REALLY sucks, seeing that it's really tough to avoid unless wherever you fight him in has enough room; also, each of those fire trails can deal 79-184 damage on a direct hit, with the flame trails dealing relatively negligible damage. To add insult to injury, he gets the attack off twice.
4. Three-Way Cluster Bomb Shot: His most lethal attack, period. Not only does it deal a staggering 168-448 damage on a direct hit, but the explosion puffs deal up to 96 points of damage individually, not to mention they can very quickly rack up. Overkill much?
5. Radius Quake: Upon flinching, he'll summon a flame pentagram around himself and make the ground around him shake, damaging you. The upside is that he apparently traded his invulnerability period for extra damage done to you if you're too close.
Comment: Yeah, my descriptions on this guy pretty much sum him up as one of the nastiest mega bosses you'll ever face. At least the death for when you kill him is pretty epic, except if you telefrag him since you'll be stuck for a while.

Hell Squire
HP: 300
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 6-60 damage.
2. Fireball: At 5-40 damage, he makes a high-end demon replacement.
Comment: A weaker hell knight that's just as easy to kill as said enemy, but appears more often among pinky-class enemies.

Hierophant
HP: 1000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: His claws do 10-100 damage per hit.
2. Fireballs: He throws a few fireballs that deal 42-112 damage on a direct hit.
3. Bolt Snake: This attack can really quickly take you down. Each bolt does 6-48 damage each, but the attack can very quickly kill you.
4. Curse Ball: This deals up to 100 damage upon a direct hit, all in splash damage.
Comment: Watch out for his missile snake attack, which can tear your health to shreds very quickly. His curse ball, strangely, does nothing for some reason.

Hunter Cyberdemon (Cyberbot)
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 10/10 (Enjoy missile and grenade hell when he's around.)
Attacks:
1. Grenade Spread: Shoots five grenades all over the place.
2. Rockets: Shoots two normal rockets off to the side as well as a homing rocket right towards your face.
Comment: This asshole spams the crap out of rockets and grenades, so you do not want to be anywhere close to this guy if you can help it. If you have to face him, I highly recommend getting the shield sphere and any damage-multiplier powerup you can (The double or quad damage is fine, even better if you have both) and kill him quickly. This is another boss I recommend nuking with the BFG's alt fire, and you damn well better land a direct hit if you want to get it over with.

Ice Baron
HP: 2000
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Blue Fireball: Same 8-64 damage.
2. Ice Ball: 5-40 damage.
3. Ice Shards: 1-8 damage per shard, and he can throw a bunch of those.
Comment: His ice balls break into fragments, but other than that, he's a more annoying baron... which isn't saying much.

Icon of Sin
HP: 250
Danger: Varies
Annoyance: Varies
Comment: While he's the typical end boss for megawads, he's a pushover if you fire a nuke (assuming you have enough BFG ammo, that is) right into the icon's forehead, killing him instantly. The monsters he spawns don't give points, but they do have a chance of spawning with powerups. Ideal if the icon battles aren't so simple.

Illus
HP: 150
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 5-50 damage, so meleeing him is a bit risky without berserk.
2. Ghost Attack: Same deal, except he summons a ghost of himself that hits for the same melee damage.
3. Shadow Ball: Deals a straight 10 damage per shot, with the fake balls not dealing any.
4. Defense Barrier: Not really an attack, but the illus summons a shield that absorbs your shots.
Comment: He can generate a defensive wall to block attacks, and comes with two sneaky missile attacks.

Imp
HP: 60 (regular), 90 (abomination), 55 (skulltag), 65 (void)
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
Abomination:
See regular imp below
Regular:
Melee: 3-30 damage.
Fireball: 3-24 damage.
Skulltag:
Fireball: 2-16 damage.
Claw: 3-30 damage.
Void:
Fireball: 5-40 damage.
Claw: 3-30 damage.
Comment: These four imp variants are the mainstay of the demonic hordes... albiet pretty easy to take out if you're armed well enough. Sure the abomination imp has 30 more hitpoints, but it pales in comparison to many of the rest of the imp-class enemies... though it's nice to see some variety.

Imp Trite
HP: 15
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 3-30 damage, but seeing that these spawn in groups...
2. Jump: 2-16 damage.
Comment: Dies very easily from any weapon, but they can kill you just as quickly if you're not paying attention.

Incubus
HP: 1500
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Comment: It's the missile attack you should really watch out for when facing him. He does drop some cells and rockets when you take him out, though.

Infernal Spider
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Flame Shots: Shoots a few big fireballs that deal 13-104 damage each.
2. Hell Ripper: The spider tends to launch this bitch-of-a-missile out, dealing 65-170 damage on a direct hit. It's blazing fast, too, no pun intended.
3. Spider Spawn: Shoots out a small swarm of either trites or mini spiders.
4. Spider Bite: Though it won't likely let you get close to it, its bite deals 12-120 damage should you actually be ballsy enough to get in its face.
Comment: It moves extremely fast, and it can summon more of its kin when the need arises. Oh, and the thing possess a missile attack that's similar to the one the baphomet possesses; this one isn't as deadly, but still can devastate your health and armor if it hits you directly.

Inferno
HP: 400
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Lava Ball: 4-36 damage per shot, and they're fairly fast, too.
2. Lava Burst: Splits into four fireballs upon biting it.
Comment: This thing's a much less annoying pain elemental, pretty much. (No lost souls, if you wanted to know how.)

Inferno Demon
HP: 6000
Danger: 8.5/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Multi-shot barrage: Shoots one of two fireball types from his six palms, and mixes it up.
* - Meteors that deal 6-48 damage per hit.
* - Lava balls that deal the same damage.
2. Fire Beams: Shoots fire beams that hit for 5-40 damage and rip through you if you stand near them.
3. Fire Glyph: If you hear a chime, move out of the spot you're on immediately, or else you'll take a nasty explosion from right under your feet.
4. Falling Meteor: The demon shoots a huge meteor into the air, only for it to land right on top of your head shortly afterwards.
5. Death Throes: Don't be near him when he falls, or you'll be getting hit with a barrage of meteors to the face.
Comment: Strangely enough, this boss demon's not immune to blast damage, so rockets are your best bet against him (the bfg's nuke attack is a one hit kill). Be careful of the fire glyph and meteor drop attacks, though.

Infernux Grand
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Rebound Bolts: The Infernux Grand fires three sets of two super-fast plasma bolts that bounce all around the place that deal 8-64 damage per tic, and they can go right through you to quickly rack up the pain.
2. Proximity Mines: This right here is the IG's nastiest attack. He can shoot out a set of two proxy mines at a time, which can blow up for up to 140 damage. You'll be scrambling for health if you survive the blast, especially without armor.
3. Ground Shockwave: at 1-8 damage per tic, this attack can shave off your health and armor levels rather quickly if you're too close.
4. Ground Torpedo: At 40-72 damage on a direct hit, this homing attack's pretty weak compared to Thamuz' homing plasma shot... though it's still pretty nasty.
Comment: The rebounding missiles are blazing fast (they're ripper projectiles, by the way), and the landmines deal massive damage upon detonation (in other words, they'll likely kill you in one to two hits per mine even with both 200% health and armor, and that's without damage reduction powerups). Also, keep your distance when he does his stomp shockwave attack.

Insanity Spider and Insanity Arachnophyte
HP: 6000 (both)
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Spreadshot Chaingun: Imagine some demon using Contra's fabled spreadshot gun against you, then you get this attack. Anyways, the plasma shots do 2-16 damage individually, but the damage WILL add up very quickly if you don't hide behind a pillar quickly.
Comment: Both of these guys shoot assloads of plasma bolts, making you feel like you're in a bullet hell... and the bolts are pretty fast, as well. If you have enough space between either of those two nightmares, you can pretty much slowly weave through their shots and take them out without taking too much damage. Alternatively, if you don't have time for that sort of crap, a direct hit from the bfg's nuke attack should kill either of the two.

Jetpack Zombie
HP: 200
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Twin Machineguns: Each bullet deals 6-18 damage.
2. Snipe Attack: Two bullets that deal 8-24 damage each.
Comment: His machine guns can help whittle your health down if he comes with other machine gunner enemies. It helps, at least, that he isn't that good at dodging projectiles.

Karasawa Zombie
HP: 100
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Karasawa Bolt: On top of dealing 12-96 damage, he can aim it off to the sides to use it to really pile on the damage; all this is giving the bolt's ripping nature.
Comment: The karasawa plasma bolts can rip through you and rebound off the walls and tear into you on the way back, and so on and so forth. If you have to fight him in tight spaces, kill him quickly.

Laser Cannon Zombie
HP: 130
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Comment: That hitscan laser weapon can take off a good amount of your health as he's extremely accurate with it, though luckily he stops firing after a while, allowing you a shot at quickly taking this prick down. He also drops a cell pack upon biting the dust.

Lava Demon
HP: 400
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Comment: Thankfully, nowhere near as annoying as the wendigos from Hexen, as their fireball fragments have little range. One last fireball can fly out of them upon death that can catch you off guard if you're not careful. Oh, and avoid getting close to them, as they have a flamethrower attack which, of course, tears your health away.

Lord of Hell
HP: 2500
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 10-100 damage.
2. Baron Fireball Flurry: Same damage as baron fireballs (8-64), but these fireballs come out in four sets of three.
3. Big Fireball: 12-96 damage.
4. Homing Fireball: Seeks you out as well as dealing the same 12-96 damage.
Comment: He's no longer immune to splash damage, but he has a few nasty missile attacks to make up for that.

Lord of Heresy
HP: 2000
Danger: 7.5/10
Annoyance: 5.5/10
Attacks:
1. Single Fireball: Throws one fireball, same 8-64 damage range.
2. Fireball Barrage: Three sets of two fireballs, similar to a mancubus. Nothing much else.
3. Three-Way Fireball Spread: This can catch you if you're not seeing it coming.
Comment: Judging from the attacks, he's a step up from the standard baron. He doesn't have that fireball nova attack he had in the Titan series, thankfully. (then again, it wasn't that bad of an attack to deal with, as that ring attack has plenty of gaps in it.)

Lost Soul
HP: 100
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Charge Attack: Goes flying in a straight line.
Comment: Upon charging, he doesn't stop flying until he hits you or a wall.

Maephisto
HP: 1000
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Chaingun: Same 5-15 damage per bullet as the standard heavy weapon dudes.
2. Twin Plasma Cannons: Each of those two shots deal 8-64 damage, and they're fast as well.
3. Plasma Cannon: The Maephisto charges up its main cannon, then lets loose a huge beam that can annihilate you if you're too slow to dodge the beam.
Comment: If it isn't the chaingun or the twin plasma cannon attacks, it's the sub-atomic beam attack that can not only temporarily blind your view as it fires but also very quickly (read: instantly) obliterate you if you get hit by it.

Machinegun Zombie
HP: 40
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Comment: Any enemy with a machinegun can be annoying if perched high up, but his low health knocks his danger level down a peg.

Malevonant
HP: 400
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Ghost Fireball Salvo: Shoots homing fireballs that tear off 2-16 health per hit.
2. Punch: 8-80 damage, probably just as nasty as a regular revenant.
Comment: Can summon tentacle demons, but his homing missiles aren't as deadly individually... though the damage can add up fairly quickly.

Mancubus
HP: 600
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Comment: Fires in a fairly erratic pattern, making dodging him pretty annoying. He can be stunlocked, though.

Mauler Demon
HP: 150
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2.5/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: Same 4-40 damage.
2. Charge Attack: A somewhat-homing charge attack that takes off 2-20 hitpoints upon contact.
Comment: Charges at you for a distance attack, and looks like a bloodfiend.

Maxibus
HP: 650
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Ball Barrage: Same damage as your plasma shots, but a much faster firing rate.
2. Plasma Torpedo Salvo: 5-40 damage per tic as these rip through you, as well as dealing up to 128 explosive damage upon hitting a wall, makes this attack one you really gotta watch out for.
Comment: The big plasma torpedoes deal a pretty nasty amount of damage, and he can also quickly shoot smaller plasma bolts. Ouch. Annoyingly, he's also immune to blast damage.

Mech Demon
HP: 230
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: Deals 5-50 per bite, only a little stronger than the regular pinkies.
Comment: Only takes one more super shotgun blast to take down because of his higher health than the regular pinkies.

Moloch
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 10/10 (Chaingun against this guy? VERY bad idea!)
Attacks:
1. Hell Grenade: These grenades can take off a good chunk of health if they hit.
2. Scorch Bolts: Whenever Moloch gets hit, these shoot off around him and deal 10-80 damage per hit. They hug the ground as well, meaning that they can climb up walls but not pillars.
3. Thunder Blast: Rips through you for 7-28 damage per tic and spawns thunderbolts that deal 5-40 damage each.
4. Earthquake: At 3-24 damage per tic, this pops up only when he finally bites it in battle.
5. Wraith Swarm: Shoots out a swarm of wraiths that tear off 5-40 health per tic.
6. Nail Salvo: These nails rip through targets for 3-12 damage per tic, and are very fast, too.
7. Claw: Getting too close to him will get you slashed by his claw for 20-200 damage.
Comment: Moloch is a very tough foe, able to chain his attacks into strings to throw off his foes.

Mutant Imp
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 5-50 damage.
2. Acid Balls: Each of those acid balls deals 2-16 damage each, with up to an additional 15 poison damage.
Comment: Be careful of the acid ball barrage, which is actually pretty tough to avoid.

Mutated Zombie
HP: 200
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 10-100 damage with the poison damage going up to 250 means that meleeing him is very risky.
Comment: This guy poisons you upon hitting you, and the poison can drain a large amount of your health, so avoid meleeing this prick if you can.

Nailborg and Nailborg Commando
HP: 120 and 230, respectively.
Danger: 4.5/10
Annoyance: 3.5/10
Attacks:
Nail Borg:
1. Nail Salvo: This guy shoots a small slew of nails that hit for 3-24 damage each.
2. Nail Bomb: A type of grenade that can severely damage you if the bomb goes off right in your face.
3. Nail Spread: Four of the nails only do 2-16 damage, with the center one doing the same 3-24 damage. Huh.
Nail Borg Commando:
Same Attacks, pretty much.
Comment: Other than a different set of sprites and one having more health, they both behave the exact same way. (It wouldn't have hurt to give the two a few more significant differences as well)

Dark Imp
HP: 80 (Nami), 200 (Netherworld), 70 (Skulltag), 90 (Void)
Danger: 3/10 (6/10 for Netherworld dark imp)
Attacks:
Nami Dark Imp:
1. Melee: He takes off 3-30 hit points per hit.
2. Homing Fireball: a missile that deals 3-24 damage per hit and homes in on you slowly.
Skulltag Dark Imp:
1. Melee: See Nami Dark Imp
2. Speedy Fireball: Same 3-24 damage, but it's very fast instead of homing.
Void Dark Imp:
1. Melee: See Nami Dark Imp
2. Dark Fireball: Same damage as a regular imp fireball
3. Strong Fireball: This one deals 6-48 damage on a direct hit.
Netherworld Dark Imp:
1. Inferno Ball: This attack deals 12-96 damage if it hits.
2. Nether Lightning: 4-32 damage, and rips through you.
3. Claw: 6-60 damage.
Annoyance: 3.5/10
Comment: The nami imps shoot homing fireballs, the skulltag ones fire faster missiles, and the void ones can alternate between regular blue fireballs and stronger red fireballs pretty much like the undead knight from Heretic. The netherworld dark imp has a few completely different attacks and is three times as tough as a regular imp... 1-2 ssg blasts can take this guy down pretty easily. (either that, or two railgun shots.)

Nightmare
HP: 100
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Surprise Slash: 4-40 damage for a chance to get shot at in return? Sucks to be him... somewhat.
Comment: As of the current version, no longer invulnerable when invisible... which is a very good thing when kill chains are concerned.

Nightmare Beast
HP: 450
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 11-110 damage. Ouch!
2. Red Ball: He pauses before throwing this, and he roars when he's about to throw it. Deals 10-80 damage.
3. Green Homing Ball: He throws a set of two homing balls that hit for 5-40 damage each ball.
Comment: He has a warm-up time before throwing either a nasty dodgeable fireball or two homing fireballs that can be very tough to dodge despite their slow speed.

Nightmare Cacodemon
HP 500
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: He shoots a few of these at a time for 4-32 damage per ball, and they're pretty quick, too.
Comment: This guy moves very fast, pretty hard to see in dark areas, and his fireballs are pretty nasty.

Nightmare Demon
HP: 200
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: Same 4-40 damage as usual.
2. Fireball: 4-32 damage, a watered-down baron ball in other words.
Comment: He's basically a spectre with a ranged attack.

Nightshade
HP: 80
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Homing Missile: 4-32 damage.
Comment: He moves very fast, and he floats. Be careful of the homing fireball though.

Obliterator
HP: 2000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 8-80 damage.
2. Fireball: Instead of rockets he shoots damaging 8-64 fireballs.
3. Flamethrower: This flamethrower deals the same damage as a hell hound's flamethrower, meaning that he has a pretty long reach.
Comment: Attacks with a fireball for long range and a flamethrower that can rack up damage quickly.

Obsidian Demon
HP: 500
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 8-80 damage means don't think about chainsawing him.
2. Ground Fire Attack: Hits for 15 damage per hit.
Comment: His ground fire attack's pretty tough to avoid, as the add-on pack manual said.

Overlord
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Ball Barrage: Shoots a swarm of thunderballs that deal 8-64 damage individually, but the barrage can very quickly kill you if you stand in front of it. The overlord balls deal up to an additional 32 radius damage, with the damage being 40-92 total damage on a direct hit.
2. Lightning Shot: Deals a jaw-dropping 50-400 damage
3. Big Lightning Ball: A really fast lightning ball that deals 16 damage per tic.
Comment: Either shoots a nasty thunder blast attack, a thunderball swarm, or summons hades spheres. If you're not going for nuking this gargantuan gasbag, I highly recommend being wary of the thunder blast attack and the hades elementals it summons.

Pain Elemental
HP: 400
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Comment: Can summon all sorts of lost soul variants in this mod, so take this guy out as soon as you see him.

Phantom
HP: 750
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Ghost Bomb: Homes in on you relentlessly and hits for up to 16 damage.
2. Red Ghost: This chases you down and chews away at you for 4-40 damage per bite.
3. Soul Missile: 6-48 damage per hit, but doesn't home in on you.
Comment: Has two very painful and very hard-to-dodge attacks (which are also pretty hard to stop, by the way)

Phase Imp
HP: 120
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 4-40 damage.
2. Homing Fireball: 4-32 damage.
Comment: Can teleport and has a homing missile attack. Enough said.

Plasma Demon
HP: 150
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 6-60 damage? Quite a step up from the standard pinky.
2. Plasma Ball: 8-64 damage per plasma ball... this thing must be a glass cannon.
Comment: Another pinky cousin with a pretty powerful ranged attack and a nastier bite.

Plasma Elemental
HP: 400
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Ball Burst: 3-24 damage... then again, that can add up quickly.
2. Plasma Nova: Don't be close when he goes down, or you'll get more plasma balls to the face.
Comment: Be careful of the plasma nova when you finally take him out.

Plasma Zombie
HP: 50
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Barrage: Shoots a few plasma balls that deal the same damage yours do.
Comment: Though he fires only several plasma shots at a time, he sometimes drops his rifle.

PlasmaBeam Zombie
HP: 50
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Beam: This beam weapon deals 1 damage per tic, but the damage can really pile on.
Comment: His plasma beam can hit you from all the way across the map and take out a good chunk of your health if you give him the chance, so take him out as soon as you can.

Poison Soul
HP: 120
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 6/10
1. Charge Attack: A charge attack that homes in on you obnoxiously. 4-32 damage if he collides with you, and he can rack the damage up pretty quickly
2. Poison Cloud: Avoid going anywhere near these clouds, as they can deal about 1-8 damage per tic, which can quickly add up if you linger in them for too long.
Comment: An aggressive lost soul variant that can also poison you. It's charging can chase you down easily, so if you see him, dispose of him immediately. (he can persistently charge into you to rack up damage rather quickly if the poison doesn't get you first)

Possessed Commander
HP: 150
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Shotgun Blast: An eight-pellet shot that can deal 8-24 damage if all the pellets hit.
2. Grenades: The douche throws a few grenades that takes off 37-72 points of health per grenade, so you gotta be careful around him.
3. Spider Imp Head Suprprise: This can catch you off guard if you're not careful.
Comment: The grenade launcher deals a large amount of damage per grenade, and his shotgun's pretty nasty as well. A spider imp head pops out of him when he bites it.

Profane One
HP: 1500
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Poison Ball: 7-56 damage in addition to 5 poison damage makes him pretty tough for a baron relative.
2. Blood Vomit: He pukes his tainted blood at you for 5-40 damage per bit of blood.
Comment: The fact that he can resurrect enemies makes taking him out top priority if you don't want to refight those painful enemies again. Also, his puke and poison missiles are both nasty as well.

Psychic Soul
HP: 120
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance 5/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: This bonehead's obnoxiously-persistent charge deals 4-32 damage upon contact.
2. Psychic Blast: A nigh-unavoidable projectile that deals 3-24 damage can piss you off pretty easily.
Comment: Even more aggressive when charging, and has a psychic attack that's nigh-impossible to avoid. Kill it quickly with the ssg.

Pustule
HP: 40
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Suicide Burst: These things can deal up to 35 damage upon blowing up in your face.
Comment: These pus sacks move really slow, so popping them from a distance should be fine.

Pyro Demon
HP: 3000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 10/10 (It's explosive teleport attack is brutal, and he loves teleporting right on top of you... or at least right next to you.)
Attacks:
1. Claw: 8-80 damage.
2. Fire Shot: Three fireballs that deal 21-28 damage.
3. Pyro Blast: This can deal a pretty nasty amount of damage, I dunno how much.
4. Teleport Explosion: Pretty nasty damage if the attack hits, and he's pretty accurate with teleporting right up in your face.
5. Comet Rain: Each comet deals 11-18 damage per hit.
Comment: Because of his teleportation attack and his cluster explosive attack, you better have some good powerups ready if you even think of taking on this bastard in tight spaces. Oh, and his regular fireballs come with splash damage too. His comet rain attack is fairly easy to dodge if you have enough room to deal with it, though... and another saving grace against this douche is that his teleport attack is only deadly (and painfully so, like I mentioned earlier) if he is level with you. (he has trouble going up and down stairs and ledges while teleporting, which I won't complain about)

Pyro Imp
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Slash: 3-30 damage.
2. Pyro Ball: 7-49 damage, and they go in an arc
Comment: The fireballs are explosive, but aren't that bad to dodge in tight spaces. For some reason, he gets gibbed even when he is killed by hitscan attacks.

Quad Shotgun Soldier
HP: 150
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Single Shot: At point-blank, this deals 15-45 damage.
2. Quad Shot: He can catch you by surprise with this attack, dealing a whooping 60-180 damage if you're right in his face.
Comment: He has a chance (albiet a small one) of firing all four barrels of his weapon at once for big damage... but he takes a short while to reload; when he's reloading is when he leaves himself most vulnerable, even though said period's pretty brief.

Quasit
HP: 500
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Gas: 35 poison damage, and it can quickly eat your health.
2. Homing Missile: 3-24 damage.
3. Cloning: Splits into three clones
Comment: At least he can't become invulnerable anymore... though this thing's still very annoying.

Rail Arachnotron
HP: 500
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Rail Salvo: Constantly shoots rail slugs that deal up to 30 damage each.
Comment: His firing rate with his railgun's slow, but it's still fairly accurate with a fair bit of damage.

Rapid Fire Zombie
HP: 30
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Rapid Fire Rifle: Well, a bit of a step up from the standard zombieman, I suppose.
Comment: He doesn't take much more punishment than the regular zombieman before he would get his rapid fire attack off.

Remote Bomb Droid
HP: 10
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 1/10 (much higher when in large groups, I assure you)
Attacks:
1. Explode: Up to 50 damage, but the groups these things come in can stack the damage up REALLY fast.
Comment: These things are only spawned by Supreme Fiends, and they often come en masse.

Repeater Zombie
HP: 130
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Repeater: Revs up shortly, then starts relentlessly firing plasma hitscan shots that hit for 3-9 damage each shot. Seeing that he won't flinch once he starts firing, kill him quickly or hide.
Comment: Stay hidden while he's firing (or kill him before he gets to use his repeater), as he can tear your health up very quickly (much moreso than other hitscan enemies, actually) if you're within his sights. (he has a short delay before he starts firing, though) He drops a cell pack when you defeat him.

Revenant
HP: 300
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Comment: He's still the bane of your existence in large groups thanks to his homing rockets... though not quite as much thanks to the more dangerous enemies cropping up.

Rictus
HP: 100
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: He shoots a few fireballs that deal 2-16 damage each.
2. Kamikaze: When he's about to bite it, he'll charge right into you for 133-168 damage on a direct hit.
Comment: Can only kamikaze into you if he's low on health, you do NOT want to get hit by that attack.

Roach
HP: 150
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Scratch: 4-40 damage.
2. Firebolt: Strangely deals 5-8 damage. Uhm... what? (correct me if I'm wrong.)
Comment: He's pretty slow to fire, but he's as tough as a pinky. I'll give it that much. It'll run away when low on health.

Rocket Zombie and Undead Rocket Marine
HP: 50 and 80, respectively
Danger: 3/10 (Rocket Zombie) and 4/10 (Undead Rocket Marine)
Annoyance: 5/10 (both)
Attacks:
Rocket Zombie:
1. Rocket: Well, you know how deadly rockets can be.
Undead Rocket Marine:
1. Rocket: This guy gets his off a little quicker, so be on your guard.
Comment: The undead rocket marine tends to be faster to fire, and their rockets can take you out very quickly on a direct hit... then again, the bazooka zombies can do that as well. The undead rocket marine does tend to drop his rocket launcher though, unlike the bazooka zombie. If these guys show up in the early levels, be really careful around them.

Saber Blade (Dark Clink)
HP: 350
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball Barrage: Shoots a small group of fireballs that hit for 2-16 damage each.
Comment: Thankfully, in this version, he can now be hittable whilst invisible.

Satyr
HP: 300
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Claw One-Two: Two claw attacks that deal 8-80 damage with each hit. Ouch!
Comment: Slow, but has a very nasty two-hit melee attack.

Sawn-off Shotgun Zombie
HP: 60
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 3.5/10
Attacks:
1. Sawn-off Shotgun Blast: His gun deals 24-72 damage at point-blank range, with each pellet doing 3-9 damage each.
Comment: His shotgun blast is a tad more damaging than the regular shotgun sergeant, as well as more accurate, so be on your guard against him.

Scorpion Tank
HP: 1600
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Twin Chainguns: Probably the same damage as a double chaingunner.
2. Rocket Shot: Fires a rocket shot very quickly, which can catch you off guard if you're not expecting it.
3. Shrapnel Shards: Once the tank blows up, the shards can rip into you for 2-16 damage per tic... and of course, the damage racks up frighteningly quickly if you let too many of them hit you.
Comment: Either hits you with its twin chainguns or a rocket. Also, don't be too close to it when it explodes.

Scourge Boss
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 10/10 (All four of its attacks can very quickly take you out, especially the homing missile barrage.)
Attacks:
1. Twin Flamethrowers: 2-16 per tic, yet the damage very quickly racks up.
2. Twin Homing Rocket Salvo: Three sets of two homing rockets which hit for 133-168 damage per hit.
3. Twin Machineguns: These machine guns' bullets hit for 1-3 damage each, but the firing rate's staggering to say the least.
4. Twin Rail Shot: The rail shots do up to 60 damage each, and he's very accurate with them.
Comment: Back when he was first introduced, he first had an annoying ability to deflect projectile attacks; thankfully, that was removed. Still, this is yet another majorly-painful boss deserving of a direct hit from a nuke (assuming you have enough ammo or are dumb enough NOT to use said alt-fire on him), especially if you have to put up with his twin flamethrowers up close or his homing missiles at a distance.

Scourge Imp
HP: 100
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 3-30 damage. Yawn.
2. Fireball: This guy's fireballs go in an arc, and hit for 6-48 damage each.
Comment: This dolt's fireball has a limited range, and he disappears shortly after dying.

Shotgun Guy
HP: 30
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Comment: The variant with the super shotgun makes this guy look like a pushover, honestly.

Shade
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: 4-32 damage.
Comment: No longer able to spawn more of itself, it can still be a pain to hit.

Shadow
HP: 80
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Shadow Ball: with 4-32 damage per ball, they take a little while before they start firing. On the flipside, they remain stationary whilst firing.
Comment: Pretty fast on it's feet, but has a rather slow-but-constant firing rate and he tends to pause before firing.

Shadow Beast
HP: 650
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Ghost Swarm: A small swarm of ghosts tends to pop out when hit with too many bullets. Per tic, those ghosts deal 1-10 damage.
2. Breath: 1-8 damage per fireball, and they rip through you.
3. Fireball: Shoots a few fireballs that sear away 5-40 hitpoints.
4. Fireball #2: 2-16 damage.
5. Fireball #3: 10-80 damage, that attack you have to watch out for.
Comment: Not only can he disintigrate to let loose souls and reappear (therefore the chaingun's not gonna work well on him), one of his breath attacks can rip through you.

Slime Imp
HP: 90
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: A fancy fireball that does 3-24 damage.
2. Claw: 3-30 damage for a melee attack? Huh...
Comment: Has a fast missile that comes with a trail attack.

Slime Worm
HP: 200
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 4-40 damage.
2. Acid Vomit: This worm spits out 4-32 attacks, with up to an additional 15 poison damage.
Comment: The acid spit attack has a pretty short range, but still pretty deadly.

SMG Zombie
HP: 60
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. SMG: He can chip off your health pretty quickly with each bullet. (I don't know the exact damage per bullet.)
Comment: He's a step down from the chaingunner, but he's not pretty accurate over a wide distance.

Smoke Demon
HP: 400
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attacks:
1. Touch Damage: He can very quickly reduce your health to nothing if you don't have a chaingun ready, or decided to melee him instead.
Comment: He can resurrect many fallen demons at once sometimes, and he's also very aggressive when he charges at you.

Snake Imp
HP: 100
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 3.5/10
Attacks:
1. Poison Ball: Despite not poisoning you on contact, it deals a whooping 16-128 damage upon hitting you. Another glass cannon if I ever saw one.
Comment: His missile attack doesn't poison you for some reason... though it's still pretty damaging for his class.

Sniper Zombie
HP: 30
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Sniper Shot: This bullet hits for 20-160 damage.
Comment: Though his bullet isn't a hitscan, his sniper bullets deal a lot of damage if he hits you with one... especially without armor, as he will likely kill you in two to three shots at 200% health. (feel free to correct me here)

Solar Demon
HP: 550
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: I dunno the exact damage, but don't get too close.
2. Cluster Ball: The demon shoots a 6-48 damage-dealing dispersion ball that breaks into smaller fireballs that bounce about the room and deal 3-24 damage apiece; these balls then break into even smaller balls that deal 1-8 damage per ball.
Comment: The rebounding dispersion balls can really catch you off guard if you let him shoot enough of them.

Zombieman (rifle)
HP: 20
Danger: 1/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Comment: He's standard cannon fodder.

Zombieman (pistol)
HP: 20
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Pistol: 20-60 damage, making his carbine incarnation look weak.
Comment: His pistol's pretty nasty. Also, he's pretty accurate with it.

Zombie Henchman
HP: 80
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Semi-Auto Pistol: Can deal anywhere between 3-18 damage per shot, and he can keep on shooting at you.
Comment: This guy can be accurate with his semi-auto pistol.

Sonic Railgun Zombie
HP: 80
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Auto-Rail: 3-6 damage per shot.
2. Charged Shot: Hits for 10-25 damage.
Comment: This guy's accuracy with his auto-railgun can grate on your nerves pretty fast if you lack armor.

Soul Harvester
HP: 80
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Homing Fireball: 2-16 damage for a slow-moving homing fireball. Weak.
Comment: Does a slow charge-up animation before releasing his relatively-slow guided missiles. Yipee.

Spreadfire Zombie
HP: 85
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
Spreadfire Shots: Relentlessly shoots 2-16 damage-dealing plasma projectiles in clusters of three per shot.
Comment: The spreadfire particles don't deal much damage individually, but he can keep you pinned down if you don't kill him quickly. He drops a plasma rifle upon dropping.

Spattertron
HP: 600
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Stream: Same damage, except he alternates between blue and green plasma balls with each shot.
2. Bouncy Plasma Barrage: Shoots red, green, and blue bouncy plasma balls. The reds deal 4-36 damage, while the greens and blues take off 5-40 health per ball.
Comment: The bouncy plasma shots shouldn't be too much trouble if you take care not to let him fill up the room with them... though some of said shots have a limited range. If you're not playing the no-infighting mode, he can also potentially kill off some of his allies with said bouncing balls on accident.

Specter
HP: 150
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Comment: Only more annoying in dark rooms.

Speed Demon
HP: 400
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Ripper Ball: A quick fireball that tears through you for 2-16 damage per tic.
2. Bomb Ball: These don't rip through you, but they can explode and deal 12-26 damage upon a direct hit.
Comment: One of his missile attacks can rip through you. Also, he's appropriately very fast.

Spider Imp Head
HP: 15
Danger: 1/10 (much higher if you let them surround you)
Annoyance: 1/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 3-30 damage per bite
Comment: They're spawned in small groups along with trites, but they can be potential kill chain builders.

Spider Mastermind
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Comment: Though she has more-powerful relatives, the super chaingun can still quickly whittle your health down to nothing if you don't hide quickly.

Spirit Imp
HP: 80
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Spirit Ball: Same 2-16 damage as a regular soul harvester ball.
Comment: Basically a soul harvester who drops a spirit that can resurrect only one enemy upon death.

Stone Imp
HP: 160
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Punch: 12-120 for a melee attack, from an imp-class enemy no less? Fisting him is a no-go, then.
2. Mini Boulder Barrage: In this version, this bastard took a page from his stone pinky friend in the final "fuck you" department. For exact damage per hit from each of those rocks, see the Stone Demon below.
Comment: He's slow but has a nasty melee attack if you're stupid enough to melee with him using the chainsaw. (trust me, you WILL likely get hit)

Stone Demon
HP: 250
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Combo Bite: Three hits of 4-40 damage... ouch!
2. Boulder Shot: A short-ranged missile that hits for 3-24 damage per bounce.
3. Mini Boulder Barrage: As one last middle finger, mini boulders can fragment everywhere off of him; said rocks deal 1-8 damage per hit, but they can very quickly rack up the damage if they bounce into you many times in a row.
Comment: The most annoying thing about him is that he can fragment into rocks upon death that can potentially do serious damage by bouncing into you several times in a row.

Suicide Bomber
HP: 60
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Explode: Up to 50 damage once he blows up.
Comment: Pretty slow, but explodes upon death or making contact with you.

Suicide Soul
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: Deals 70-160 damage if he makes direct contact with you, not to mention exploding as well.
Comment: Can deal a large amount of damage upon exploding in your face.

Sunhegor
HP: 850
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: Deals a whooping 15-150 damage per hit.
2. Fireball: Deals 9-72 damage per fireball, and they're fast, too.
3. Flaming Death: Once he bites it, he erupts into a pillar of flame that can leave you running for health if you survive it.
Comment: At least he doesn't leave a corpse upon death, as his fireballs can be pretty nasty... though getting close when he explodes is a REALLY bad idea.

Super Baron
HP: 2000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Rev Rocket/Manc Fireball Combo: This is essentially the same attack the Dehacked versions of the Afrits use.
Comment: Pretty fast, and shoots a crapton of fatso fireballs and a few revenant rockets like the afrits from Scythe 2... and yeah, this bastard is a major pain in the ass especially in tight spaces or worse, you have to fight two or more of them.

Super Cyberdemon
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Revenant Rocket Spread: Shoots five revenant rockets.
2. Manc Fireball Flurry: Shoots a crapton of mancubus fireballs.
3. Archvile Attack: If you're familiar with how an archvile attack works, avoiding it should be no problem.
4. Bouncing Balls: Shoots bouncing balls that deal a relatively piddly 3-24 damage per ball. That attack isn't too bad compared to the other three attacks.
5. Quad Rocket Salvo: Shoots four rockets in a row.
6. Homing Torpedo: 10-80 damage per hit, and they home in on you pretty well.
Comment: Pretty fast on his feet, and one of his attacks is a homing ground torpedo that is nearly as damaging as his regular rockets (I'm not sure)... and he also has an archvile attack. Great.

Super Flying Imp
HP: 60
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: 8-64 damage.
Comment: His green fireballs tend to deal a big amount of damage per ball... and he looks exactly like a regular flying imp until he attacks.

Super Hell Knight
HP: 1000
Danger: 7/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Slimeball/Thunderball Combo: Two baron fireballs and Caco thunderballs all in a row.
Comment: Faster, but still fairly easy if you have enough space against him.

Super Imp
HP: 60
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Baron Fireball: "The Baron of Hell called, he wants his fireball back."
Comment: His super fireball is pretty nasty if you let it hit you. Enough said.

Super Shotgun Zombie
HP: 60
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
Super Shotgun Blast: Practically about the same damage as your own SSG.
Comment: Up close, his weapon can deal serious damage. Also, he's pretty quick to fire, so stay well away from him if you can't put him down quickly. If you can take him out, the SSG's yours to keep.

Superdemon
HP: 4000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 7.5/10
Attacks:
1. Triple Fireball Salvo: These quick fireballs deal 15-120 damage per hit, making fighting him without armor a death wish if you're not good at dodging.
Comment: A high-ranking demon who proves to be just as brutal, before his cybernetic operations, pretty quickly; his missiles are a tad faster.

Supreme Fiend
HP: 6000
Danger: 10/10
Annoyance: 10/10 (the droid swarms can REALLY get in the way AND fuck you up)
Attacks:
1. Plasma Balls: 5-40 damage, meaning this is the least deadly of his attacks.
2. BFG Blast: It's the same 100-800 damage on direct hit, not including tracers.
3. Droid Swarm: Spawns droves of remote bomb droids.
Comment: The droid swarm and the bfg blast attack are reasons enough to either kill this badass quickly or stay the hell away from him. Like I said for many of the earlier megaboss enemies, nuke this guy if you got enough cell ammo, and make sure he's not summoning suicide droids.

Surreal Demon
HP: 400
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Fireballs: 1-8 damage per fireball. Ok...
Comment: His soul dealt damage to everyone that was near whenever this thing died back in its first introduction... along with a resurrection ability along with his two missile attacks. (not sure if he still has the revive fallen demons ability, though)

Technocaco
HP: 650
Danger: 5/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Silver Balls: Shoots a small bunch of silver balls that hit for 2-16 damage each.
2. Homing Metal Ball: Shoots a homing mace ball that deals 4-32 damage in addition to fragmenting into nails upon contact.
Comment: One of his missile's a guided missile attack while the other... I think splits into fragments. At least he explodes upon death.

Tentacle
HP: 125
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Eye Blast: 3-24 damage
2. Fireball Flurry: 1-8 damage, but can quickly rack up the pain.
Comment: Only spawned by malevonants, but it can deal decent damage with its missile attacks.

Terminator
HP: 2500, 1500 for the Hell Knight Class version
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 9/10
Attacks:
1. Machinegun: Each bullet can deal 4-24 damage per bullet, seeing that it's two bullets per shot.
2. Blaster: This explosive fireball deals 55-160 damage on direct contact, and he can fire two of those.
3. Red Star: A nasty homing bolt that deals 10-80 damage upon hitting you.
4. Red Grenade: The grenade attack has a very high one-hit-kill potential if the thing smacks you right in the face.
Comment: The grenade attack's the one attack to really watch out for, as if he wasn't feared enough already.

Terror
HP: 100
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Charge: Same deal with the run-of-the-mill lost souls.
2. Explode: At 160 explosion damage, you'll be REELING if you survive.
Comment: Deals a crapton of damage for his class if he explodes right next to you, much like the suicide soul.

Thamuz
HP: 6000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 9/10 (Beware the homing plasma blast of death)
Attacks:
1. Homing Plasma Blast: Ah, the dreaded homing plasma missile of death. It deals 150-220 damage on a direct hit, which means that you'll be severely crippled in both health and armor levels; even at full 200% health, chances of surviving a direct shot from that will blow your ass into oblivion unless you had a damage-reduction powerup active on you.
2. Green Rocket Salvo: Each of these missiles deals 15-120 damage upon hitting you, and this attack's preferable to the homing plasma one.
3. Green Flame Nova: Instead of invulnerability, getting too close when he initiates the attack damages you. On top of that, each of those ground fire trails can burn off 84-224 hitpoints upon hitting you. Thankfully, this is his easiest attack to avoid if you know where to stand, but don't think you can survive a direct hit from one of those attacks with just your 200% max health.
Comment: At least he's a little easier now that he can no longer turn invincible... but still, you should be wary when fighting him... especially his homing plasma shot.

Tortured Soul
HP: 500
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Eye Blast: A fast cacodemon ball damage-wise.
2. Poison Cloud: Each tic the cloud rips through you will have you suffering 5-20 damage. (Strife damage values are 1d4)
3. Poison Gas Nova: Once this gasbag pops, stay away from the gas clouds.
Comment: The poison cloud can tear through you, and the eye blast does a fair bit of damage. Other than the poison cloud nova "attack" when he finally goes down, this guy's not all that bad unless you're, of course, in tight spaces. (Then again, a lot of the enemies are even worse in tight spaces.)

Trite
HP: 30
Danger: 1/10
Annoyance: 1.5/10
Comment: Sure they're spawned in small droves, but the chaingun (or either of the shotguns if you prefer) can mop them up quickly.

UAC Bot
HP: 1000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Chaingun: Being very accurate, it can shred you if you don't hide quickly.
2. Grenades: Each of these grenades deal 148-288 upon a direct hit, the same damage as a rocket.
Comment: The chaingun, though very capable of tearing you to shreds just like other hitscan machine gunner enemies, pales in comparison to the grenades it can lob. If anything, it's right up there with the next enemy down on the list

UAC Patrol Bot
HP: 50
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Rail Shot: 1-8 damage per shot, and it shoots two at a time.
Comment: It can float, and it's lasers are very fast. Otherwise, easy meat.

UAC Security Drone
HP: 150
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Fireball: These things shoot two bolts that deal 1-8 damage each.
Comment: Spawns in small groups, but any weapon that can take them out efficiently and quickly should suffice.

Unmaker Zombie
HP: 60
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Unmaker Shot: This zombie deals 10-30 damage with each hitscan shot from his unholy weapon.
2. Rail Blitz: 5 damage per shot, out of a salvo of five.
Comment: With that weapon of his, he can hit you from across the map and it's very hard to dodge the fairly-damaging rail shots (On top of that, he fires those rail shots quickly.) The upsides of this guy is that he has little health and drops bullet and cell ammo when he goes down; in other words, kill this guy quickly before he fires.

Veste
HP: 500
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 3/10
Attacks:
1. Thunderbolts: 3-24 damage, and shot in sets of two.
2. Blaster Shots: 1-3 damage hitscan shots.
Comment: One of his lightning attacks is a hitscan attack, so be careful when you fight this guy.

Vetis
HP: 1000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Fire Stream: He can throw three fire streams at you, that quickly tear into your health and armor.
2. Enemy Summon: This guy can summon either shadows or lost souls.
Comment: The homing ground flame attack can quickly decimate you, and he can summon lost souls and shadows to help him out... though those reinforcements are easily dispatched.

Vile King
HP: 1000
Danger: 9/10
Annoyance: 8.5/10
Attacks:
1. Flame Pillar: Same standard archvile attack.
2. Fireball Type 1: 8-64 damage.
3. Fireball Type 2: Same damage, except homes in on you.
3. Big Fireball: This one deals 12-96 damage per fireball.
4. Death Throes: Blows up in a big dome of fireballs.
Comment: Be careful of the last "attack" he pulls off as he dies. Also, he has a few attacks that can take you out fairly quickly in addition to the regular hitscan explosion attack.

Vulgar
HP: 70
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Claw: 4-40 damage, but pretty slow.
2. Poison Bolt: 4-32 damage with an added bonus up to 32 extra points.
Comment: This guy can potentially deal big damage... but you shouldn't let him deal that much damage

Watcher
HP: 175
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 4-40 damage.
2. Fireball: 3-24 damage.
Comment: Think of this thing as a weaker, slower cacodemon.

Warlord of Hell
HP: 2000
Danger: 8/10
Annoyance: 7.5/10
Attacks:
1. Phase 1 - Single Ball: Simply chucks the usual 8-64 damage fireball.
2. Phase 2 - Two-Way Shot: Hurls two fireballs once he hits 1000 hitpoints.
3. Phase 3 - Manc-Style Barrage: Three sets of two fireballs in an erratic pattern, similar to the Heresy Lord. He pulls this off once his health dips to 500 hp.
Comment: He throws more fireballs as his health drops, so watch for that.

Wicked
HP: 200
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Homing Fireball: 5-40 damage.
Comment: Be careful of the homing fireballs this guy shoots.

Wolfenstein SS
HP: 50
Danger: 2/10
Annoyance: 2/10
Comment: You usually only meet these guys in special wolfenstein-themed levels, but these guys are pretty much pushovers. (Though certain megawads can replace them, and some of the replacements turn out to be incredibly annoying.)

Wraith Imp
HP: 150
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Slash: 4-40 damage.
Comment: He can teleport towards you, making blowing him up with the rocket launcher a crapshoot at best. The ssg can instantly drop him, though.

Xenodemon
HP: 300
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Bite: 10-100 damage. Ouch!
2. Mini Thunderball Swarm: These deal up to 4 damage, but the damage can rack up a bit.
3. Big Homing Thunderball: 3-24 damage per tic, and can rip through you, piling on the pain.
Comment: One of his missiles is a homing one, and a fairly nasty one at that. Other than that, he shouldn't take too long to down with the ssg (only two point-blank blasts).

Zombie Flyer
HP: 150
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Lasers: The lasers deal 2-16 damage per bolt.
2. Explosion: This deals up to 32 damage if you're too close when it goes down.
Comment: He's a little more annoying than the pig cop recon patrol craft from Duke Nukem 3D, but at least the drivers are easily killed once they fall.

Zombie Marine
HP: 80
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Machinegun: Same 5-15 damage per shot, but faster than the rapid fire trooper.
Comment: Another fairly annoying machine gunner-type enemy. Deal with this guy like you would with others of his caliber.

Zombie Railgunner
HP: 45
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 5/10
Attacks:
1. Railgun: Up to 30 damage per shot.
Comment: The railgun shots from this guy don't deal so much damage, he can still be pretty annoying to deal with if he's perched in a place where you can't see him and he can still hit you.

Zombie Tank
HP: 300
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 8/10
Attack:
1. Machineguns: Each shot can deal 1-6 damage (two bullets fired at a time), however this thing can quickly whittle your health down upon getting within range.
Comment: The machine guns are very annoying as they come out very quickly and can whittle your health away rapidly if you give it the chance to, and you shouldn't. Unlike the scorpion tank, this tank's driver comes out for one last chance to take you out, but said driver's still pretty wimpy.

Zombie Plasma Tank
HP: 300
Danger: 3/10
Annoyance: 6/10
Attacks:
1. Plasma Barrage: A relentless stream of plasma shots that deal 1-8 damage each.
Comment: The plasma bolts do come out fast, but after the tank goes down, the driver's easy meat.

ZSec Special Ops Zombie
HP: 200
Danger: 6/10
Annoyance: 7/10
Attacks:
1. Machinegun: Same 5-15 damage per bullet, but he has a pretty high rate of fire as well as pretty accurate.
Comment: He's pretty hard to hit as he can strafe about, and he's accurate with his gun to boot. Kill this guy quickly.

ZSec Zombie
HP: 60
Danger: 4/10
Annoyance: 4/10
Attacks:
1. Machinegun: Each bullet of his deals 1-3 damage, but he's just as quick with piling on the damage... though sometimes he'll need to reload.
2. Grenade: Deals 50 damage on a direct hit.
Comment: Just like the rest of the machine gunner enemies, only he also comes packed with a mini grenade launcher.
